## Chapter 4: SketchUp Basics

### Five Core Concepts

* It's a surface modeler.
* There are no vector curves.
* SketchUp geometry is sticky--adjoining surfaces stick together.
* Geometry does not stack in sketchup, only one edge or surface can exist between the same series of points. [NOTE: this isn't true programmatically]
* The inference engine is vital, and can take suggestions.

### Creating Geometry

* Two groups of common tools, drawing and modification
* Use the drawing tools to create 2D geometry and set up for the modification tools
* Two drawing tool groups, surface drawing and edge drawing

* "Any surface in a container that has the default material applied to it will take on the material of its parent."
