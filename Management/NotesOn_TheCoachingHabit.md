# You Need a Coaching Habit

* Statistically speaking, you're probably not getting or giving good coaching.
* Probably at least 3 reasons the first go at a coaching habit didn't work:
    * Training was overly theoretical, complicated, boring.
    * You probably didn't spend time translating the insights into action so you'd do things differently.
    * It's surprisingly difficult to give a little less advice and ask a few more questions.
* Over time the author and his company have come to these truths:
    * Coaching is simple.
    * You can coach someone in ten minutes or less.
    * Coaching should be a daily, informal act.
    * You can build a coaching habit, but only if you're methodical.
* Why is it worth doing? It lets you break three vicious cycles:
    1. Creating overdependence
        * Your team gets too reliant on you
        * That's disempowering for them, stressful for you
        * Coaching helps your team become more self-sufficient
    1. Getting overwhelmed
        * Coaching helps you regain focus
        * Lets you and your team do the work that has real impact
    1. Becoming Disconnected
        * You get disconnected from the work that matters
        * Coaching helps you and your team connect to the work with meaning

## The Seven Essential Questions

* Seven questions to break those three vicious cycles
* The questions work with lots of people, not just at work

# How to Build a Habit

* Duke study said at least 45% of our waking behavior is habitual
* Habits are hard to break, can be hard to build
* You need five things to build a new habit:
    * a reason - Don't spend too much time imagining the outcome, but get clarity on the payoff. It can help to think in terms of what it might do for others you care about.
    * a trigger - A high degree of specificity on the trigger is helpful.
    * a micro-habit - Short and Specific--abstraction and vagueness make it difficult to get any traction, and if it takes a long time to do your brain will find a way around it. Try for less than 60 seconds to complete at first.
    * effective practice - use Deep Practice, which has three components:
        * Practice small chunks of the bigger action
        * Repetition.
        * Being mindful, noticing when it goes well, celebrating success.
    * a plan - Build resiliency into your system, so the inevitable small failures don't become larger failures.

## Put it all together: the new habit formula

* This company has shifted more and more to helping clients define and commit to specific habits rather than action lists.
* Their New Habit Formula has three parts:
    * Identify the Trigger 
        * Charles Duhigg says there are five types of trigger:
            * location
            * time
            * emotional state
            * other people
            * the immediately preceding action
        * Combine those as necessary to specifically articulate the trigger
    * Identify the Old Habit
        * Specifically articulate the old habit.
    * Define the New Behavior
        * One that will take 60s or less

## A final word on building your coaching habit

* It's hard to change behavior, and you'll get internal resistance.
* Tips to counter that resistance:
    * Start somewhere easy. 
    * Start small.
    * Buddy up / build support systems.
    * Get back on the horse when you fall off.
