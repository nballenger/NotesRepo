Part I: Fundamentals

    * "The assessment of color quality will be made according to the judgments of 
        human observers."
    
1: Measuring Color
    Light Sources:
        * Observed color is reflected light.
        * "In order to measure color, then, it first is necessary to measure the 
            characteristics of the light source providing the illumination."
        * You have to measure the "spectral power distribution" of the light source
        * There can be a number of different light sources in a single digital image system
        * Example: "An original scene is photographed on a color-slide film, and the 
            slide is projected and also scanned. The scanned image is temporarily displayed
            on the monitor of a computer workstation, and a scan printer is used to
            expose a photographic paper to produce a reflection print that is then viewed."
        * Six different light sources:
            - light illuminating the original scene
            - light used to project the slide for direct viewing
            - light in the slide-film scanner
            - computer monitor phosphors
            - scan printer light source
            - light source illuminating the reflection print for viewing
            
    Objects:
        * Light that hits an object is absorbed, reflected, or transmitted, and the ratio
            of those three things is determined by the chemical makeup of the object,
            among other factors.
        * For color measurement, the variation is described in terms of 'spectral
            reflectance' or 'spectral transmittance' characteristics, whcih describe the
            fraction of the incident power reflected or transmitted as a function of wavelength.
        * The reflectance/transmittance can be off from what the human eye perceives--
            the human visual system has quirks in relation to wavelength perception.
            
    Color Stimuli:
        * A 'color' to be viewed or measured is a 'color stimulus'
        * Color stimuli always consist of light, sometimes broadcast, usually reflected 
            from or transmitted through various objects
        * The spectral power distribution of a stimulus (light shining on an apple) is the
            product of the spectral power distribution of the flourescent source and the
            spectral reflectance characteristic of the apple. Calculated by multiplying
            the power of the light source by the reflectance of the object at each wavelength.
        * For a reflective or trasmissive object, the color stimulus results from both
            the object and the light source--if a different light source is used, the 
            stimulus will change.
        * Representing color images in numeric form is the process of giving every spatial
            point in a scene or image an associated spectral power distribution.
            
    Human Color Vision:
        * Human color vision derives from the responses of three types of photoreceptors
            (cones) in the retina, each with different spectral sensitivities.
        * Sensitivity rapidly decreases above 650nm, and below 400nm
        * Curves representing the estimated spectral sensitivities (Œ≤ / beta for blue, 
            gamma / ∆î for green, rho / ùùÜ for red)
        * Plotting the spectral reflectance of an object / light source across the HVS
            curves shows you the perceived color stimuli
        * Combination of photoreceptors lets humans distinguish ~10M color sensations
        * Two color stimuli having very different spectral power distributions can have
            identical color--a 'metameric pair', generally called 'metamerism'
        * Because of metamerism, it isn't necessary to record or reproduce the actual
            spectral power distribution of an original color stimulus--just a visual 
            equivalent to it.
        * Metamerism involves the matching of stimuli, not objects or light sources
        
    Colorimetry:
        * Scientific foundation of color science, basis for predicting metamerism
        * Gives methods for specifying a color stimulus by relating the measurement of its
            spectral power to the trichromatic responses of a defined standard observer.
        * Two stimuli producing the same trichromatic responses are metameric by definition
        * Founded on a series of color matching experiments, where a color was half 
            illuminated by a test lamp, and half by RGB primary lamps--the amounts of
            the primaries required to match the test lamp color are the 'tristimulus values'
            of the test color, for that set of color primaries.
        * Sequential runs of the experiment give curves: 'color matching functions'
        * Color matching functions represent the tristimulus values needed to match a
            defined amount of light at each spectral wavelength.
        * Some of the tristimulus values are negative--this is because some colors cannot
            be matched by any combination of the three primaries, but can be matched by
            using two primaries and adding an amount of the third to the test lamp.
        * "The color-matching functions for _any_ set of physically realizable primaries 
            will have _some_ negative values."
        * The number of possible sets of primary colors is unlimited, and consequently so
            is the number of color matching functions.
        * However, they're all linear combinations of one another, so a matrix operation
            can be used to transform one set of color matching functions to another
            
    CIE Colorimetry
        * Commision Internationale de ''Eclairage (International Commision on Illumination)
        * CIE adopted (1931) a set of color matching functions to define a 'Standard
            Colorimetric Observer' representing the non-colorblind human population
        * zbar = blue/beta, ybar = green/gamma, xbar = red/rho
        * CIE standard colorimetric observer color matching functions let you calculate
            CIE tristimulus values X, Y, and Z
        * "The X, Y, and Z tristimulus values for a given object (characterized by its 
            spectral reflectance or transmittance) that is illuminated by a light source
            (characterized by its spectral power distribution) can be calculated for the
            CIE standard colorimetric observer (characterized by CIE color-matching functions
            by summing the products of these distributions over the wavelength range of
            380 to 780nm, usually at 5nm intervals."
            
                  780
            X =  k E       S(lambda) R(lambda) xbar(lambda)
               lambda=380
                           
                  780
            Y =  k E       S(lambda) R(lambda) ybar(lambda)
               lambda=380

                  780
            Z =  k E       S(lambda) R(lambda) zbar(lambda)
               lambda=380
               
        * Where X, Y, and Z are CIE tristimulus values, S(lambda) is the spectral power
            distribution of a light source, R(lambda) is the spectral reflectance of a
            reflective object (or the transmittance of a transmissive object);, xbar(lambda),
            ybar(lambda) and zbar(lambda) are the color matching functions of the CIE
            Standard Colorimetric Observer, and k is a normalizing factor.
        * k usually is determined such that Y = 100 when the object is perfect white.
        * A 'perfect white' is an ideal, nonflourescent, isotropic diffuser with a 
            reflectance or transmittance equal to unity throughout the visual spectrum
        * Isotrpic means incident light is reflected or transmitted equally in all
            directions, so brightness is independent of viewing direction.
        * The color matching functions for the CIE Standard Colorimetric Observer have no
            negative regions--they are composed of 'imaginary primaries' corresponding to
            hypothetical illuminants having negative amounts of power at some wavelengths.
        * The primaries aren't physically realizable, but are useful mathematically, and
            let you construct colorimeters that directly measure XYZ values
        * Y corresponds directly to the measurement of 'luminance', which is an important
            correlate to the subjective perception of 'brightness'
        * Ceteris parabis, a stimuli with a higher luminance will appear brighter
        * The following normalizations and definitions specifically relate to the 
            measurement of luminance values:
            
            - The normalization may be such that Y tristimulus values are evaluated on
                an absolute basis and expressed in units of luminance, typically candelas
                per square meter (cd/m^2).
            - When the normalization is such that the Y tristimulus value for a perfect
                white object is 1.0, normalized Y values are called luminance-factor values
            - When the normalization is such that the Y tristimulus value for a perfect
                white object is 100, normalized Y values are called percent luminance-
                factor values.
                
        * X and Z have no direct perceptual correlates, but are used in the calculation of
            chromaticity coordinates x, y, and z:
            
            x = X / (X+Y+Z)
            y = Y / (X+Y+Z)
            z = Z / (X+Y+Z)
            
        * The plot of y vs x is a 'chromaticity diagram'
        * The horseshoe shaped outline is the 'spectrum locus', a line connecting the points
            representing the chromaticities of the spectrum colors
        * The ends of the spectrum locus are connected by a straight line: the 'purple boundary'
        * All physically realizable color stimuli lie within the spectrum locus/purple boundary
        * The points within the spectrum locus representing the real RGB primaries form
            a triangle, within that triangle are all stimuli that can be matched using
            non-negative amounts of the real primaries
        * The points of the triangle formed by the imaginary XYZ primaries encloses the
            entire spectrum locus, so you can form all color stimuli from those.
        * CIE has recommended the use of other color-coordinate systems derived from XYZ:
            - CIE 1976 u', v' Metric Chromaticity Coordinates
            - CIE 1976 L*a*b* (CIELAB)
            - CIE 1976 L*u*v* (CIELUV)
        * All the CIE coordinate systems are good for finding color differences, though
            none of them indicate the perception (appearance) of the stimuli
        * CIE coordinate systems DO NOT represent color appearance
        
    Other Color Measurements
        * Applications involving hard copy media are concerned with 'optical density'
        * optical density is measured with densitometers
        * Optical densities are measured using three channel or four channel densitometers
        * Densitometers are different from colorimeters
        * Most scanners are densitometers
        

2: Color-Imaging Systems
    * All imaging systems must perform three basic functions:
        - image capture
        - signal processing
        - image formation
        
    Image Capture
        * Detecting light from each original color stimulus, and producing a detectable
            signal from that light.
        * Accurate color reporduction requires trichromatic image capture
        * As part of the capture process, the spectral content of original color stimuli
            must be separated to form three distinguishable color signals
        * Occasionally more than three color channels are captured, and trichromatic signals
            are derived from those inputs
        * Capture is sometimes done with overlaid sensors, sometime with mosaiced rgb sensors
        * In video cameras, a beam splitting prism redirects light to three sensors
        * Photographic film uses different range sensitive layers on the film base
        * The individual color responses, called exposures, produced by a given set of 
            spectral responsivities can be calculated using the following equations:
            

                Rexp = kcr E S(lambda) R(lambda) rc(lambda)
                         lambda
                         
                Gexp = kcg E S(lambda) R(lambda) gc(lambda)
                         lambda
                         
                Bexp = kcb E S(lambda) R(lambda) bc(lambda)
                         lambda                                                  
                         
        * Where Rexp, Gexp and Bexp are red/green/blue exposure values, S(lambda) is the
            spectral power distribution of the light source, R(lambda) is the spectral
            reflectance or transmittance of the object, rc(lambda), gc(lambda), bc(lambda)
            are the red/green/blue spectral responsivities of the image-capture device or
            medium, and kcr, kcg, kcb are normalizing factors.
        * The normalizing factors are usually determined such that Rexp, Gexp, Bexp = 1.0
            when the object is a perfect white.
        * It's the equivalent of doing a white balance adjustment on a digital camera.
        
    Signal Processing
        * Modifies image signals produced in image capture to make them suitable for 
            producing a viewable image
        * Typically includes linear and nonlinear transformations operating on the
            individual color signals
        * Used to create linear and nonlinear interactions (crosstalk) among the individual
            color signals. Modified red signal might be formed by taking portions of the
            green and blue signals and adding or subtracting them from the original red.
        * Can also include things like compression, sharpening, noise reduction, etc.
        
    Image Formation
        * Producing a viewable image--processed signals are used to control the color-
            forming elements of the output medium or device.
        * Almost all methods are either additive color or subtractive color
        * Additive color: processed image signals are used to directly control the 
            intensitities of primary colored lights that make up the displayed image.
            Colors are produced by additive mixing.
        * Subtractive color: processed signals control the amount of three or more
            colorants that selectively absorb light of specific wavelength regions.
        * An image formed by subtractive colorants is an 'object', requiring a light
            source for viewing.
            
    Complete Color-imaging systems
        * "Any combination of devices and/or media capable of performing all three basic
            functions described here."
            

3: The Human Color-Imaging System
    * Context: an original and a reproduction, to be viewed by a human observer, who
        will judge the quality of the reproduction.
    * You can't substitute a system like XYZ or L*a*b* for the HVS to judge reproduction, 
        because the HVS is actually comparing the end products of the mental visual process.
    * "Psychological signal processing" includes effects due to color memory, which is
        generally not colorimetrically accurate, and color preference, as well as various
        cognitive effects that cause the observer to perceive colors according to
        expectations and experience.
    * "Psychophysical signal processing" includes effects due to both physiological and
        mental processes.
                
    Adaptation
        * Process by which the visual mechanism adjusts to the conditions under which the
            eyes are exposed to radiant energy.
        * Three adaptation effects of particular importance to color-imaging media/systems:
            - General-brightness adaptation: adjustments of the visual mechanism in response
                to the overall level of the stimulus to which the eyes are exposed. HVS is
                a relative system, not absolute, works under a wide range of conditions. 
                However, absolute luminance levels cause a difference in 'luminance contrast',
                where the light and dark differences between stimuli of higher and lower
                luminances are less apparent.
            - Lateral-brightness adaptation: sensitivity of a particular receptor may be
                influenced by the amount of light received by neighboring receptors. Helps
                make edges more apparent. Makes the apparently luminance contrast of an image
                lower when areas immediately surrounding it are relatively dark.
            - Chromatic adaptation: adjustments of the visual mechanism in response to the
                average chromaticity of the stimulus to which the eyes are exposed. Essentially
                this describes a white balance shift that occurs in the image processing system.
                
    Colorimetry and Human Vision
        * Standard CIE colorimetry emulate the image capture (trichromatic response) stage
            of the human visual system
        * Therefore colorimetry can be used to determine if two stimuli will produce the
            same trichromatic values, and this will predict whether those stimuli will
            match if they are viewed under identical conditions.
        * By itself, CIE colorimetry does not emulate the signal processing or image-
            formation functions of the HVS
            
Part II: The Nature of Color Images
    * Color images are the end product of color-imaging systems, and a source of input in
        digital imaging systems.
    * Images are often reused despite being from very different color contexts.
    * To deal with that, you have to be aware of the colorimetric profiles of systems.
    
4: Electronic Displays
