## Chapter 1: Unique Challenges of Virtual Teams and Their Leaders

* Challenges, particularly those spanning cultural boundaries, include:
    * Large projects require careful orchestration of effort
    * Lack of face to face time means trust develops slowly
    * Time zone differences limit real time communication windows
    * Cultural/language barriers can make communication frustrating
    * Team members operate on uneven playing field in terms of resource access, proximity to decision makers, information sharing, etc.
    * Harder for team members to tell when they're out of alignment with team
    * Giving/getting performance feedback often more awkward, less frequent
    * Easier for disconnected team members to renege on commitments

    * Creating an open team environment is harder without direct social time
    * Harder to match people to tasks with less sense of each person's strengths
    * Creating shared understanding of goals, etc. takes more time and effort
    * Creating a level playing field where people feel equally valued, respected, able to contribute fully is very difficult.
    * Getting buy-in on norms is often skipped, with bad results
