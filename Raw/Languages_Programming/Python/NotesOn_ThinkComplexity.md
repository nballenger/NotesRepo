# Notes on 'Think Complexity'

by Allen B. Downey, O'Reilly Media, 2012

## Executive Summary

## Chapter Summaries

### Chapter 1: Complexity Science

#### What is this book about?

* Data structures, algorithms, computational modeling
* Python
* Philosophy of science

#### A New Kind of Science

* Contrasts classical science (Newton, planetary motion) with a cellular agent modeling of segregation in Detroit
* The second seems more like actual modeling, while the first attempts to derive more fundamental rules
* Says complexity models still do useful work.

#### Paradigm Shift?

* Says complexity science is less a Kuhn style revolution, more of a "gradual shift in the criteria by which models are judged and in the kinds of models that are considered acceptable."
* Classical models tend to be law based, complexity models are rule based, expressed by computation, and simulated rather than analyzed.
* "I claim&mdash;and this is a central thesis of this book&mdash;that the criteria upon which [the consensus among scientists about which models are 'good science'] is based change over time, and that the emergency of complexity science reflects a gradual shift in these criteria."

#### The Axes of Scientific Models

* Shift over time from classical to complexity is largely a shift along two axes:
	* Equation-based &rarr; simulation-based
	* Analysis &rarr; computation
* Additional axes that will be referenced within the book:
	* Continuous &rarr; discrete
	* Linear &rarr; non-linear
	* Deterministic &rarr; stochastic
	* Abstract &rarr; detailed
	* One, two &rarr; many
	* Homogeneous &rarr; composite

#### A New Kind of Model

* "Complex models are often appropriate for different purposes and interpretations."
* Shifts:
	* Predictive &rarr; explanatory
	* Realism &rarr; instrumentalism
	* Reductionism &rarr; holism

#### A New Kind of Engineering

* "[C]omplexity is also a cause, and effect, of changes in engineering and the organization of social systems."
* Shifts:
	* Centralized &rarr; decentralized
	* Isolation &rarr; interaction
	* One-to-many &rarr; many-to-many
	* Top-down &rarr; bottom-up
	* Analysis &rarr; computation
	* Design &rarr; search

#### A New Kind of Thinking

* "[T]he shifts I am postulating in the criteria of scientific modeling are related to 20th century developments in logic and epistemology."
* Shifts:
	* Aristotelian logic &rarr; many-valued logic
	* Frequentist probability &rarr; Bayesianism
	* Objective &rarr; subjective
	* Physical law &rarr; theory &rarr; model
	* Determinism &rarr; indeterminism

	
### Chapter 2: Graphs

#### What's a Graph?

* **graph** &mdash; abstraction used to model a system that contains discrete, interconnected elements
* **nodes / vertices** &mdash; elements in a graph
* **edges** &mdash; connections between elements in a graph
* Edges can be directed or undirected, weighted or unweighted.
* Graph algorithms can solve/model a number of real world problems
