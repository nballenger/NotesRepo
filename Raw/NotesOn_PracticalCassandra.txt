Chapter 1: Introduction to Cassandra

1.6 What is Cassandra?
  * Open-source, distributed database management system
  * Large amounts of data, spread across commodity servers
  * Hybrid of key/value store and row store
  * Any node can serve any request
  * Supports replication and MDC replication
  * CQL (Cassandra Query Language) helps with data modeling and access
  * Developed at facebook in 2008, when to ASF in 2009, top level project in 2010
  * Most recent for this book's purposes is 1.2
  * Considered "schema-less"
  * Allows schema creation if you know your data structure
  * Has no built in full text search
  * No b-tree indexes or data manipulation functions
  * So you don't get SUM, GROUP, JOIN, MAX, MIN, etc. that modify data at query time

1.7 Cassandra Terminology
  * Cluster -- two or more Cassandra instances working together
  * Homogeneous environment -- each node contains everything to complete a cluster
  * Node -- an instance of Cassandra
  * Replication Factor -- keyspace setting for how many copies of data to hold
  * Tunable Consistency -- you can specify consistency level at read/write time

Chapter 2: Installation

2.1 Prerequisites
  * Set JAVA_HOME, add jdk/bin to the PATH
  * The data directories hold the SSTables
  * Data directories should be on a different physical volume than the commitlog,
    because the commitlog does append-only, and the data directory wants random seeks
  * All directories must be writable by the cassandra user:
    - /var/lib/cassandra/data         <-- data directories
    - /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog    <-- commit log
    - /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches <-- key/row caches for startup loading
    - /var/log/cassandra              <-- log directory

2.2 Installation
  * Add the EPEL repo to use yum
  * For binaries get them from apache or datastax and untar

2.3 Configuration
  * Most important options in the cassandra.yaml file:
    - cluster_name
    - num_tokens, default 256, number of tokens randomly assigned to the node
      for three nodes, if one has ten and two have five tokens, the data will go 50%
      to the first box and 25% to the remaining two respectively
    - initial_token, default blank. If not using vnodes, or only one token per node,
      the initial token specifies where in the range the node belongs
    - authenticator, default org.apache.cassandra.auth.AllowAllAuthenitcator
      the java class for authentication
    - authorizer, default org.apache.cassandra.auth.AllowAllAuthorizer
      the java class that limits and grants permissions to cassandra objects
    - permissions_validity_in_ms, default 2000. How long to cache permissions for 
      the Authorizer. Ignored under AllowAllAuthorizer
    - partitioner, default org.apache.cassandra.dht.Murmur3Partitioner
      the java class that partitions data between cluster nodes
    - data_file_directories, default /var/lib/cassandra/data
    - commitlog_directory, default /var/lib/cassandra/commitlog
    - disk_failure_policy, default: stop, can be best_effort or ignore
    - saved_caches_directory, default /var/lib/cassandra/saved_caches
    - commitlog_sync, default periodic, can be batch
    - commitlog_sync_period_in_ms, default 10000, time in which Cassandra fsync writes
      to disk. If doing batch, make this value low because writes will block
    - commitlog_segment_size_in_mb, default: 32, how big before creating a new file
    - seed_provider, default org.apache.cassandra.locator.SimpleSeedProvider
      the java class that will provide the seeds that will allow nodes to autodetect
      the cluster. Important to have many seeds so new nodes can still bootstrap during
      an outage of one of the seed nodes.
    - concurrent_reads, default 32, set it to 16 * number of disks in use by the
      data_file_directories
    - concurrent_writes, default 32, 16 * number of cores in the machine
    - memtable_total_space_in_mb, default not specified. Limit at which Cassandra will
      flush the largest MemTable. Will flush by default at 1/3 of heap size.
    - listen_address, default: localhost

2.4 Cluster Setup
  * Installing and running will run a single node cluster
  * You can only take external connections if you change listen_address from localhost
  * In multinode, new nodes need to know about the existing nodes
  * Discovery is via gossip protocol.
  * When you bring in a new node, you need to specify a seed node, which are nodes used
    to give information about the cluster to newly joining nodes.
  * Seed nodes should be stable and point to other seed nodes.
  * More specifics here, will look at if necessary.

Chapter 3: Data Modeling
  
3.1 The Cassandra Data Model
  * Creating a table in CQL is telling Cassandra the name and data type, but also how
    to store and distribute the data.
