# Notes on Think Python

## Executive Summary

## Chapter Summaries

### Preface

* 1999, teaching Java, decided to write a book for students
* Goals
    * Keep it short
    * Minimize jargon, define terms
    * Build gradually, split complex topics up
    * Focus on programming, not the language
* Somebody translated book to Python, author republished it

### Chapter 1: The Way of the Program

#### The Python Programming Language

* Discussion of: high vs low level languages, interpreters/compilers, interactive Python vs script mode.

#### What Is a Program?

* Basics: IO, math, conditionals, repetition

#### What Is Debugging?

* Three kinds of errors: syntax, runtime, semantic

##### Syntax Errors

* Not following the rules of the language for well-formedness.

##### Runtime Errors

* Also called exceptions, happen during execution.

##### Semantic Errors

* Program runs, but does not do what is expected of it.

#### Experimental Debugging

* Discussion of hypothesis testing, minimal changes, going from one good state to another.

#### Formal and Natural Languages

* Natural languages are spoken by humans. They have ambiguity, redundancy, and metaphor.
* Formal languages are designed for specific tasks, have strict rules. They are largely unambiguous, concise, and literal.

#### The First Program

```
print 'Hello, World!'
```

#### Debugging

* Try making the mistakes implied by the book.


### Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, and Statements
