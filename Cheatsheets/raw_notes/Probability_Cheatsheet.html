  <h2>Terms:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>An <strong>experiment</strong> or <strong>trial</strong> produces a <strong>result</strong> or <strong>outcome</strong>.</li>
    <li>A set (1 to N) of outcomes is an <strong>event</strong>.</li>
    <li>The collection of all possible results is a <strong>sample space</strong>.</li>
    <li>Events A and B are <strong>disjoint</strong> if A &Intersection; B = &emptyset;.</li>
    <li>Events A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>,... are <strong>mutually exclusive</strong> or <strong>pairwise disjoint</strong> if any two of the events are disjoint.</li>
    <li>Events A, B, C, ... are <strong>exhaustive</strong> if their union equals the entire sample space.</li>
    <li>Events E<sub>1</sub>, ..., E<sub>n</sub> are <strong>independent</strong> if the occurrence of one event does not affect the probabilities of others.</li>
    <li>Sampling <strong>with replacement</strong> means every sampled item is replaced into the initial set, so that any of the objects can be selected with probability 1/<em>n</em> at any time. In particular, the same object may be sampled more than once.</li>
    <li>Sampling <strong>without replacement</strong> means that every sampled item is removed from further sampling, so the set of possibilities reduces by 1 after each selection.</li>
    <li>Objects are <strong>distinguishable</strong> if sampling of exactly the same objects in a different order yields a different outcome, that is, a different element of the sample space. For <strong>indistinguishable</strong> objects, the order is not important, it only matters which objects are sampled and which ones aren't. Indistinguishable objects arranged in a different order do not generate a new outcome.</li>
    <li><strong>Conditional probability</strong> of event A given event B is the probability that A occurs when B is known to occur.</li>
    <li>A <strong>random variable</strong> is a function of an outcome--a quantity that depends on chance.</li>
    <li>A collection of all the probabilities related to X is the <strong>distribution</strong> of X. The function P(x) = P{X = x} is the <strong>probability mass function (pmf)</strong>. The <strong>cumulative distribution function (cdf) is defined as F(x) = P{X &lt;= x} = sum(P(y) for all y lte x).</li>
    <li>The set of possible values of X is the <strong>support</strong> of the distribution F.</li>
