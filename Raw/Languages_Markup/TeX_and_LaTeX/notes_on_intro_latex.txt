Notes on The Not So Short Introduction to LaTeX2e
by Tobias Oetiker, Hubert Partl, Irene Hyna and Elisabeth Schlegl

Chapter 1: Things You Need to Know
    1.1 The Name of the Game
        1.1.1 TeX
    1.2 Basics
        1.2.1 Author, Book Designer and Typesetter
            * LaTeX is the "book designer" and TeX is the typesetter
            * Author has to provide additional information to specify the logical structure of the work
            * That structure is written in LaTeX commands
        1.2.2 Layout Design
            * Formatting errors are prevented by declaring the logical structure of the document
        1.2.3 Advantages and Disadvantages
            * Advantages:
                - Handles a lot of stuff like math
                - Looks real good like
                - Has a bunch of packages
            * Disadvantages:
                - Time consuming
                - Hard to write unstructured docs
    1.3 LaTeX Input Files
        * Plain text files are the input
        1.3.1 Spaces
            * White space is ignored beyond one space
        1.3.2 Special Characters
            * Following are reserved:
                # $ % ^ & _ { } ~ \
            * Escaped by backslash prefix
            * \\ is not escaped backslash, use \textbackslash instead
        1.3.3 LaTeX Commands
            * Start with a backslash
            * Names are letters only, terminated by a space, number or non-letter character, OR
            * They are a backslash and exactly one non-letter
            * Many commands exist in a 'starred' variant where a star is appended to the command name
            * Insert a {} after a command to add whitespace, else the whitespace following the command is factored out
            * Some commands take required parameters inside curly braces
            * Some have optional parameters inside brackets
        1.3.4 Comments
            * From a percent sign to carriage return + leading white space of next line is a comment
            * Longer comments can be created with the comment environment provided by the verbatim package:
                
                \usepackage{verbatim}
                \begin{comment} blah blah blah \end{comment}
                
    1.4 Input File Structure
        * A document structure is expected
        * Files start with \documentclass{...}
        * Then come commands to influence the style of the whole doc or load packages
        * Then \begin{document}
        * End is at \end{document}

    1.5 A Typical Command Line Session
        * Very simple document:
            
            \documentclass{article}
            \begin{document}
            Small is beautiful.
            \end{document}
            
        * To compile your input file:
            - Create the input file as plain text, extension .tex
            - run 'latex filename.tex', which will give you a .dvi file
            - View the dvi file with xdvi foo.dvi & (with x11)
            - Convert the dvi file to PostScript with 'dvips' -Pcmz foo.dvi -o foo.ps
            - Convert to pdf with 'dvipdf foo.dvi'
    
    1.6 The Layout of the Document
        1.6.1 Document Classes  
            * \documentclass[options]{class}
            * Classes:
                - article, proc, minimal, report, book, slides
            * Options:
                - font size, paper size, fleqn (formulae is left aligned), leqno (numbering of formulae is on left instead of right), titlepage/notitlepage, onecolumn/twocolumn, twoside/oneside, landscape, openright/openany (whether a chapter can start on the right or either side)
            * Example declaration:
                
                \documentclass[11pt,twoside,a4paper]{article}
                
        1.6.2 Packages
            * \usepackage[options]{package}
            * texdoc will let you access package documentation
            * Some packages:
                - doc, excale, fontenc, ifthen, latexsym, makeidx, syntonly, inputenc
        
        1.6.3 Page Styles
            * \pagestyle{style}
            * Supports three predefined header/footer combinations, the style parameter sets which to use
            * Choices are plain, headings, and empty
            * Single page style can be set with \thispagestyle{style}
        
    1.7 Files You Might Encounter
        * .tex is a latex input file
        * .sty is a Latex macro package, for use with \usepackage
        * .dtx is documented tex, which when processed gives you documented macro code for a package contained in the .dtx file
        * .inx is the installer for files contained in a .dtx
        * .cls is a class file defining what your document looks like
        * .fd is a font description file
        
        * .dvi is a Device Independent File, and is the main result of running a latex compile on a source file
        * .log gives a detailed account of what happened during the last compiler run
        * .toc stores all your section headers
        * .lof is like .toc but for the list of figures
        * .lot is the same but for tables
        * .aux is for shunting info from one compiler run to the next
        * .idx is an index for your document, processed with makeindex
        * .ind is the processed form if .idx
        * .ilg is a logfile telling what makeindex did
        
    1.8 Big Projects
        * If you want to split the input file into several parts, you can use the \include{filename} command
        * It will insert the contents of the named file at that point in the document
        * A new page will be started before processing the new file
        * In the preamble you can use \includeonly{filename, filename,...} to tell latex to only include some files
        * \input{filename} lets you insert content without a page break being used
        * To quickly check document syntax, do this:
        
            \usepackage{syntonly}
            \syntaxonly
            
Chapter 2: Typesetting Text
    2.1 The Structure of Text and Language
        * blah blah blah, paragraphs are great
    2.2 Line Breaking and Page Breaking
        2.2.1 Justified Paragraphs
            * To force a line break, use \\ or \newline (which will not start a new paragraph, and thus will not indent)
            * \\* will prohibit a page break after the forced line break
            * \newpage will insert a page break
            * \linebreak[n], \nolinebreak[n], \pagebreak[n], \nopagebreak[n] all suggest places where a break may happen, with n being between 0 and 4, leaving it up to latex
            * You can tell latex to lower standards by using \sloppy, and raise them again with \fussy
        2.2.2 Hyphenation
            * Latex will hyphenate when necessary
            * You can use \hyphenation{word list} to tell latex that the words listed in the argument should be hyphenated only at the points marked with a - character
        
    2.3 Ready-Made Strings
        * There are special text strings you can get for free:
            \today  current date
            \TeX    tex name, formatted
            \LaTeX  latex name, formatted
            \LaTeXe current version of latex
            
    2.4 Special Characters and Symbols
        2.4.1 Quotation Marks
            * You can get curly quotes with:
            
                 `blah blah blah'   single
                ``blah blah blah''  double
                
        2.4.2 Dashes and Hyphens
            * Four kinds of dashes:
                blah-blah-blah      single dash
                pages 13--67        endash
                yes---or no?        emdash
        
        2.4.3 Tilde
            * use \~{} for a high up tilde
            * use $\sim$ for a lower, bigger tilde character
            
        2.4.4 Slash
            * To set a slash between two words but maintain their separateness as 'words' for latex's purposes, do word\slash word
        
        2.4.5 Degree Symbol
            * $-30\, ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$
            * \textcelsius{}
            * \textdegree{}
            
        2.4.6 The Euro Currency Symbol
            * \usepackage{textcomp}
            * \texteuro
            or
            * \usepackage[official]{eurosym} for the official one
            * \usepackage[gen]{eurosym} for one matching your font
            
        2.4.7 Ellipsis
            * \ldots
            
        2.4.8 Ligatures
            * use \mbox{} between letters to prohibit a ligature
            
        2.4.9 Accents and Special Characters
            * Example:
            
                H\^otel, n\"\i ve, \'el\'\`eve,\\
                
    2.5 International Language Support
        * You need to set automatically generated text strings
        * You can use the babel package for a lot of this
        * you have to set the hyphenation rules
        * you have to set the language specific typographic rules
        
    2.6 The Space Between Words
        * Normal assumption about sentence endings is that it will be a lower case letter followed by a period, question mark or exclamation point
        * Exceptions have to be specified
        * \@ in front of a period indicates it terminates a sentence even if it follows an upper case letter
        * additional spaces after periods can be disabled with \frenchspacing
        
    2.7 Titles, Chapters and Sections
        * The following are available from the article class:
        
            \section{...}
            \subsection{...}
            \subsubsection{...}
            \paragraph{...}
            \subparagraph{...}
            
        * To split the document without influencing the section or chapter numbering:
        
            \part{...}
            
        * The report and book classes also have
        
            \chapter{...}
            
        * To change the chapter numbering to letters:
        
            \appendix
            
        * To insert a table of contents (requires double compilation):
            
            \tableofcontents
            
        * All sectioning commands also have starred versions
        * Generates section headings that do not show up in the table of contents, and are not numbered;
        
            \section*{Help}
            
        * To give specific text for the TOC version:
        
            \chapter[Title for use in the TOC]{A longer title that wouldn't fit in the TOC}
            
        * The title of the whole document is generated with \maketitle
        * Contents of the title have to be defined with the following:
        
            \title{...}, \author{...}, \date{...}
            
        * After which you call \maketitle
        
        * Additional commands for use with the book class:
            - \frontmatter immediately follows \begin{document}, and will switch page numbering to roman numerals
            - \mainmatter comes right before the first chapter
            - \appendix marks the start of additional material
            - \backmatter goes right before the very last parts, like the bibliography and index
            
    2.8 Cross References
        * \label{marker} sets a mark
        * \ref{marker} creates a link to the mark
        * \pageref{marker} prints the page number of the mark
        
    2.9 Footnotes
        * \footnote{footnote text} prints a footnote on the current page
        
    2.10 Emphasized Words
        * \underline{text}
        * \emph{text}
        
    2.11 Environments
        * \begin{environment} text \end{environment}
        * environments can be nested
        
        2.11.1 Itemize, Enumerate and Description
            * itemize is for simple lists
            * enumerate for enumerated lists
            * description for descriptions
            * example:
            
                \flushleft
                \begin{enumerate}
                \item This is numbered
                \begin{itemize}
                \item This is bulleted
                \item[-] This has a dash
                \end{itemize}
                \item Back to numbering
                \begin{description}
                \item[Word] definition of the word
                \end{description
                \end{enumerate}
                
        2.11.2 Flushleft, Flushright and Center
            * Environments that generate paragraphs that are aligned one way or another
            
        2.11.3 Quote, Quotation and Verse
            * quote is useful for quotes, phrases and examples
            * quotation is for longer quotes, and indents each para
            * verse is for poems where line breaks are important
            
        2.11.4 Abstract
            * Usually used with the article class
            * used like
                
                \begin{abstract}
                The abstract abstract.
                \end{abstract}
                
        2.11.5 Printing Verbatim
            * Anything in \begin{verbatim} \end{verbatim} will be directly printed, as if on a typewriter
            * Inside a para, use the \verb+text+ command to do pre-type formatting for a span
            
        2.11.6 Tabular
            * tabular environment can be used to set tables with optional horizontal and vertical lines
            * width of the columns is determined automatically
            * begins with:
            
                \begin{tabular}[pos]{table spec]
                
            * The table spec part defines the format of the table:
                - l is a column of left-aligned text
                - r is right alined text
                - c is centered text
                - p{width} for a column justified with line breaks
                - | for a vertical line
            * The positional argument gives the vertical position of the table relative to the baseline of the surrounding text, and is one of:
                - t for top
                - b for bottom
                - c for center
            * & jumps to the next column
            * \\ starts a new line
            * \hline inserts a horizontal line
            * partial lines can be added with \cline{i-j} where i and j are column numbers the line should extend over
            * Examples:
            
                \begin{tabular}{|r|l|}
                \hline
                7CO & hexadecimal \\
                3700 & octal \\ \cline{2-2}
                11111000000 & binary \\
                \hline \hline
                1984 & decimal \\
                \hline
                \end{tabular}
                
                \begin{tabular}{|p{4.7cm}|}
                \hline
                Welcome to Boxy's paragraph.
                We sincerely hope you'll all enjoy the show.\\
                \hline
                \end{tabular}
                
            * Column separator can be defined with @{...}
            * That kills the inter-column space and replaces it with whatever is between the curly braces
            * You can use it to deal with alignment or leading space
            * Material typeset with the tabular environment always stays together on one page
            * To set long tables, use the longtable environments
            * To increase the spacing of the tables, you can use \arraystretch and \tabcolsep:
            
                \begin{tabular}{|l|}
                \hline
                The lines\\\hline
                are tight\\\hline
                \end{tabular}
                
                {\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
                \renewcommand{\tabcolsep}{0.2cm}
                \begin{tabular}{|l|}
                \hline
                less cramped\\\hline
                table layout\\\hline
                \end{tabular}}
                
    2.12 Floating Bodies
        * To avoid breaking figures and tables across pages or leaving big blocks of open space, you can float a figure or table to the next available page
        * Commands for floats:
        
            \begin{figure}[placement specifier]
            \begin{table}[...]
            
        * The placement specifier tells latex about which locations the float is allowed to be moved to
        * It's written as a string of float-placing permissions
        * The float placing permissions are
            - h  here at the point where it occurs
            - t  at the top of a page
            - b  at the bottom of a page
            - p  on a special page with only floats
            - !  without considering most parameters which would stop the float from being placed
        * The \caption{caption text} command will add a caption to a float, and a running number or string will be added
        * You can use \caption[Short]{looooong}
        * Use \label and \ref to create a reference to a float within the text
        * \label must come after \caption, since \label will reference \caption
        * Example:
        
            Figure~\ref{white} is an example of Pop-Art.
            \begin{figure}[!hbtp]
            \makebox[\textwidth]{\framebox[5cm]{\rule{0pt}{5cm}}}
            \caption{Five by Five in Cintemetres.\label{white}}
            \end{figure}
            
        * \clearpage or \cleardoublepage will immediately place all floats in the current queue and go to a new page
        
    2.13 Protecting Fragile Commands
        * Some commands, like \footnote and \phantom, are 'fragile' and cannot be used in the argument of \section-like commands
        * You can protect them with \protect, which will let them work normally even in moving arguments
        * Example:
        
            \section{I am considerate
                \protect\footnote{and protect my footnotes}}
                
        
        
Chapter 6: Customizing Latex
    6.1 New Commands, Environments and Packages
    6.2 Fonts and Sizes
        6.2.1 Font Changing Commands
            * To set the font and font size by hand, use the commands
            
            * Fonts:
                \textrm{...}    roman
                \texttt{...}    typewriter
                \textmd{...}    medium
                \textup{...}    upright
                \textsl{...}    slanted

                \textnormal{...}    document font
                
            * Font Sizes:
                \tiny           tiny font       
                \scriptsize     very small
                \footnotesize   quite small
                \small          small
                \normalsize     normal
                \large          large
                \Large          larger
                \LARGE          very large
                \huge           huge
                \Huge           largest
                
            * You can use the size changing commands as arguments to a section, like:
            
                \begin{Large}
                Blah blah blah
                \end{Large}
                
        6.2.2 Danger, Will Robinson, Danger
            * You can use \newcommand to defined a 'logical wrapper command' for the font changing command:
            
                \newcommand{\oops}[1]{%
                 \textbf{#1}}
                Do not \oops{enter} this room,
                it's occupied by \oops{machines}
                of unknown origin and purpose.
                
            * Basically lets you define a style that you can reset later, rather than having to go through and find and redefine each usage of \textbf
        
    6.3 Spacing
        6.3.1 Line Spacing
            * To change the large inter-line spacing in a document, change its value with \linespread{factor} in the preamble of the document
            * \linespread{1.3} would give one and a half, \linespread{1.6} for double
            * default spread factor is 1
            * To set the spread on a smaller scale, use
            
                {\setlength{\baselineskip}%
                           {1.5\baselineskip}
                blah blah blah
                \par}
                
        6.3.2 Paragraph Formatting
            * There are two parameters influencing paragraph layout
            * Example from doc preamble:
            
                \setlength{\parindent}{0pt}
                \setlength{\parskip}{1ex plus 0.5ex minus 0.2ex}
        
            * Those commands increase the space between two paragraphs while setting the para indent to zero
            * The plus and minux tell latex it can compress and expand the inter-para skip by the amount specified, if necessary
            * To indent a para that is not indented, use \indent at the beginning
            * To unindent a para, use \noindent
            
        6.3.3 Horizontal Space
            * To add horizontal space, use \hspace{length}
            * If the space should exist even at the beginning or end of a line, use \hspace*
            * length is a number and a unit
            * \stretch{n} generates a stretchable space, will take up all remaining space on a line
            * Units:
                mm      millimeter
                cm      centimeter
                in      inch
                pt      point
                em      width of an M
                ex      width of an x
                
        6.3.4 Vertical Space
            * You can add \vspace{length}
            * To preserve it at top or bottom of a page, use \vspace*
            * \stretch with \pagebreak can set text on the last line of a page, or center text vertically:
            
                Some text \ldots
                \vspace{\stretch{1}}
                This goes onto the last line of the page.\pagebreak
                
            * With \\[length] you can put space between lines
            * With \bigskip and \smallskip you can put in a predefined set of vertical space
