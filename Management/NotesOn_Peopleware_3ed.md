# Part 1: Managing the Human Resource

* Technical people sometimes try to manage people like components.
* It doesn't work.
* Part 1 is about a different way of thinking about and managing people, with specific accomodation to the nonmodular nature of humans.

# Chapter 1: Somewhere Today, a Project is Failing

* Hypothetical: an accounts receivable software project is failing, and you can examine it before everyone runs away
* You would not find that the technology was the problem.
* They studied a bunch of dev projects and results (500+ project histories)
* 15% of projects come to nothing: canceled, aborted, postponed, or delivered products that were never used
* 25% of projects that lasted 25+ work-years failed to complete
* For the overwhelming majority, there was not a single technological issue to explain the failure

## The name of the game

* Most cited cause of failure: "politics", which stood in for:
    * communication problems
    * staffing problems
    * disenchantment with boss or client
    * lack of motivation
    * high turnover
* Call it instead a project's 'sociology', truly political problems were a subset
* Talking about sociology rather than politics makes it more tractable
* Underling thesis of the book:

    > The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.

* Most managers concede they have more people issues than tech issues, but they then don't actually manage for that--they manage as though tech was the principal concern.
* Background brings a certain bias, engineers tend to want to / like to solve technical problems
* Main reason to focus on tech is that it's easier

# Chapter 2: Make a Cheeseburger, sell a Cheesburger

* Development is inherently different from production, but managers let their thinking be shaped by management derived from production.
* Hypothetically you're manager of a fast food place. You can change production for efficiency by:
    * Squeezing out error
    * Taking a hard line about goofing off on the job
    * Treat workers as cogs in a machine
    * Optimize the steady state (don't think about what it took to get up to speed or what it would take to close down)
    * Standardize procedures
    * Eliminate experimentation (innovation comes via pipeline)
* Those approaches can be fatal in development work. Kills morale, focuses attention away from the problems at hand.
* Proposed opposite approach in following sections.

## A Quota for Errors

* Knowledge work involves errors, period. Don't conflate error with bad workers.
* Use iterative design:
    * Some designs are inherently defect-prone
    * Those should be rejected, not repaired
    * Such dead ends should be expected as part of the process
* "Fostering an atomosphere that doesn't allow for error simply makes people defensive."
* In fact, you should encourage people to make some errors. Ask people what dead end roads they've gone down, and make clear that "none" isn't a good answer.

## Management: The Bozo Definition

* Stupid view: management does all the thinking and the people underneath carry it out
* Everyone needs to be able to use their brain. You can kick people to make them active, but not to make them creative, inventive, and thoughtful.
* Most people actually like their work if allowed to do it.

## The People Store

* Convenient to think of people as part of a production machine, that you can replace interchangeably
* Everyone may be replaceable, but in fact their uniqueness is a big part of the functioning of the project sociology
* "The uniqueness of every worker is a continued annoyance to the manager who has blindly adopted a management style from the production world. The natural _people_ manager, on the other hand, realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective."

## A Project in Steady State is Dead

* A project's entire purpose is to put itself out of business.
* "Unless you're riding herd on a canceled or about-to-be canceled project, the entire focus of project management ought to be the _dynamics_ of the development effort."

## We haven't got time to think about this job, only to do it

* You always need time for brain work not actually contributory to the single task at hand
* Ask the question of whether something should be done at all
* "If an excuse is needed for the lack of think-time, the excuse is always time pressure--as though there were ever work to be done without time pressure."
* "The project that has to be done by an impossible fixed date is the very one that can't afford _not_ to have frequent brainstorms and even a project dinner or some such affair to help the individual participants knit into an effective whole."
* Analysis of system development projects says people only spend about 5% of time total on all of:
    * planning
    * investigating new methods
    * training
    * reading books
    * estimating
    * budgeting
    * scheduling
    * allocating personnel

# Chapter 3: Vienna Waits for You

## Spanish Theory Management

* Spanish Theory of value: a fixed amount of value exists on earth, and therefore the path to the accumulation of wealth was to learn to extract it more efficiently from the soil or from people's backs.
* English theory: value can be created through ingenuity and technology
* English had an industrial revolution, spanish spent time ripping gold out of the new world and its people, ended up with horrible inflation
* Many managers use the Spanish Theory in regards to productivity
* "Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay."

## And now a word from the home front

* Message at work may be to work longer and harder, but at home it's that life is passing you by.
* People are well aware that there are more important things than your tasks.

## There ain't no such thing as overtime

* It's almost always followed by a period of 'undertime' where people catch back up with their lives. It cancels out over the long run.
* "Nobody can really work much more than forty hours, at least not continually and with the level of intensity required for creative intellectual work."

## Workaholics

* They'll put in uncompensated overtime, though with declining effectiveness.
* They'll ruin their personal lives for you, but sooner or later they figure out what's happening, and you lose them, forever.

## Productivity: winning battles and losing wars

* If you try to increase "productivity," you better also look at turnover
* Things orgs do to try to increase productivity:
    * pressure people for more hours
    * mechanize the process of product development
    * compromise product quality
    * standardize procedures
* Any of those can make work less enjoyable and less interesting, which risks the motivation of your employees
* Costs of this kind of stuff: turnover, replacing experienced employees
* Do NOT treat productivity as if turnover were an externality or cost-free

## Reprise

* "Each of us has succumbed at one time or another to the short-term tactic of putting people under pressure to get them to work harder. In order to do this, we have to ignore their decreased effectiveness and the resultant turnover, but ignoring bad side effects is easy. What's not so easy is keeping in mind an inconvienent truth like this one: _People under time pressure don't work better--they just work faster._ In order to work faster, they may have to sacrifice the quality of the product and of their own work experience."

# Chapter 4: Quality - If Time Permits

* 20th c psych theory says our character is dominated by basic instincts:
    * survival
    * self-esteem
    * reproduction
    * territory
    * etc.
* When you feel those, "there is always passion involved. Even the slightest challenge to one of these built-in values can be upsetting."
* Strong emotions typically mean an instinctive value is threatened. You can't manage people without taking emotional responses into account.
* "[I]n the workplace, the major arouser of emotions is threatened self-esteem."
* People tie their self-esteem to the quality of the product they produce.

## The Flight from Excellence

* "Managers jeopardize product quality by setting unreachable deadlines."
* Under time pressure, there's no freedom to trade off resources, add more people or functionality.
* You end up delivering products that are incomplete and unstable, with hidden problems. Your workers hate doing it, but don't feel like they have a choice.
* There _is_ a real tradeoff between "getting it right" and "getting it soon enough to matter," but pressuring people into compromising their sense of quality has real and persistent costs, and is usually a mistake.
* Managers tend to view quality as an attribute that you can have more or less of, depending on need.
* Builders tend to tie their self-esteem to their understanding of quality, and so they impose their own quality standards.
* "The minimum that will satisfy [builders of software] is more or less the best quality they have achieved in the past. This is invariably a higher standard than what the market requires and is willing to pay for."
* The software industry has accustomed clients to accept in-house-developed code with an average defect density of 1-3 defects per hundred lines of code. That often gets blamed on builders--who would like more than anyone to get it right.
* "We have to assume that the people who pay for our work are of sound enough mind to make a sensible trade-off between quality and cost. The point here is that the client's perceived needs for quality in the product are often not as great as those of the builder."
* "Allowing the standard of quality to be set by the buyer, rather than the builder, is what we call _the flight from excellence._ A market-derived quality standard seems to make good sense only as long as you ignore the effect on the builder's attitude and effectiveness."
* **"In the long run, market-based quality costs more. The lesson here is: _Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity._"**
* Uses Japan as an example, says the trade-off between price and quality doesn't exist in Japan, since the idea that high quality brings on cost reduction is widely accepted. Seems simplistic to me, but sure, okay.

## Quality is free, but...

* Philip Crosby wrote a book, _Quality is Free_, in 1979. Gave a bunch of examples and a sound rationale for the idea that letting the builder set a satisfying quality standard of his own results in productivity gains sufficient to offset the cost of the improved quality.
* They think the book did more harm than good, because lots of people know only the title, and take it as the message.
* Real message of the linked effects on quality and productivity:

    > Quality is free, but only to those who are willing to pay heavily for it.

## Power of Veto

* In some Japanese companies project teams have an effective veto over delivery of what they believe to be not-yet-ready products.
* Takes a certain amount of courage to defer to that power to employees. Principal concern would be with Parkinson's Law, which is the next chapter.

# Chapter 5: Parkinson's Law Revisited

* 1954, C. Northcot Parkinson introduced the notion that work expands to fill the time alloted for it.
* Gives managers the sense that the only way to get things done is to set an impossibly optimistic delivery date.
* As these things go, it's not entirely axiomatic. Parkinson didn't collect data, run experiments, etc. The guy was a humorist, and his 'law' caught on because it was funny.
* There's a grain of truth in it, but _Parkinson's Law almost certainly doesn't apply to your people._

## You wouldn't be saying this if you'd ever met our Herb

* Every manager has at least anecdotal evidence of workers avoiding work, or having no standard of quality, or not being able to get the job done.
* "In a healthy work environment, the reasons that some people don't perform are lack of competence, lack of confidence, and lack of affiliation with others on the project and the project goals."
* Even if leaning on someone is needed, the manager isn't the person to do it.
* Treating people as Parkinsonian workers demeans and demotivates them.

## Some data from the University of New South Wales

* Two NSW researchers ran annual surveys in the 80's and 90's, measuring live projects in industry according to a common data collection standard.
* Every year focused on a different aspect of project work, with the 1985 surving providing some data that reflects on the "inapplicability" of Parkinson's law
* Were looking at the productivity effect of various estimating methods, seeking to prove/disprove "the folkloric belief that developers (programmers in this case) work harder if they're trying to meet their own estimates."
* For each of 103 projects, calculated a weighted metric of productivity
* Grouped the same into subgroups depending on how the original estimates were made
* Some of the datapoints:
    * Effort estimate prepared by programmer alone (N=19):
        * Average productivity: 8.0
    * Effort estimate prepared by supervisor alone (N=3):
        * Average productivity: 6.6
    * Effort estimate prepared by programmer and supervisors (N=16):
        * Average productivity: 7.8
* Seems to confirm the folklore, saying that programmers are a bit more productive if they do their own estimates, slightly less so if managers are involved, and worse if managers do it for them.
* In 21 projects under study, estimates were done by a third party, typically a systems analyst. Devs in those caess substantially outperformed the first three categories:
    * Effort estimate prepared by systems analyst (N=21):
        * Average productivity: 9.5
* This does NOT confirm the folkloric view
* Authors believe that bad estimates are always a demotivating factor, and that the systems analyst tends to be a better estimator than the programmer or the supervisor. They know the work in more detail, but are not hampered by the natural optimisim of the person actually doing the job, or the political or budgetary biases of management. Also systems analysts typically have more estimating experience.
* Most surprising part of the study appeared at the end, when they looked at 24 projects for which no estimates were prepared at all.
    * Effort estimate not prepared (N=24):
        * Average productivity: 12.0
* Doesn't definitively disprove Parkinson's law doesn't apply to developers, but is very interesting.
* **"The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child: If punishment is rare and your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent, then maybe it can help. If you do it all the time, it's just a sign that you've got problems of your own."**

## Variation on a Theme by Parkinson

* Slight variation on the 'law' which is "frighteningly true in many orgs": _Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day._

# Chapter 6: Laetrile

* Laetrile - colorless liquid pressed from inside of apricot pits, used in baking. In Sweden you can buy it in the grocery store. In Mexico you can buy it for fifty dollars a drop to cure cancer (which it doesn't).
* People who are desperate enough don't look very hard at evidence.

## Lose fat while sleeping

* There is a lot of pressure to improve productivity, but there are no longer very many "easy" solutions, because we're in a maturing discipline. Sort of.
* Some orgs are still way better at it than others.

    > We're convinced that those who do better are not using any particularly advanced technology. Their better performance can be explained entirely by their more effective ways of handling people, modifying the workplace and corporate culture, [etc.]

## The Seven Sirens

* False hopes are engendered by technological nonsolutions
* Particular ones that show up are industry specific
* Seven they've identified from software development, with the authors responses:
    * **There is some new trick you missed to send productivity soaring.**
        * **Response** - You didn't miss anything so fundamental. Anybody who says otherwise is selling something.
    * **Other managers are getting gains of 100% or 200% or more!**
        * **Response** - Bullshit.
    * **Technology is moving so swiftly that you're being passed by.**
        * **Response** - Most work in software isn't high-tech or truly innovative.
    * **Changing languages will give you huge gains.**
        * **Response** - As long as you're up to speed with the last few years of stuff, you're probably fine, and changes would give you a pretty marginal bump.
    * **Because of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately.**
        * **Response** - Most things wallowing in a backlog don't produce enough real value to be worth building, and should probably be scrapped.
    * **You automate everything else, shouldn't you automate your software devs?**
        * **Response** - Devs aren't actually all that automatable. Most of their "work" is human communication to organize users' expression of needs into formal systems. That work is necessary no matter how you structure the lifecycle.
    * **Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure.**
        * **Response** - They won't, they'll just enjoy it less.

## This is Management

* Management's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

# Part 2: The Office Environment

* Looks at some causes of lost time, proposes measures for creating a healthy, work-conducive environment

# Chapter 7: The Furniture Police

* Hypothetical: you are responsible for space and services for your team. Have to decide on the kind of workplace for each person, how much space and expense to allocate
