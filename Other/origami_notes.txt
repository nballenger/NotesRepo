A piece of paper can be represented in 3d space as a bounded plane
A fold of that plane will:
    Introduce one or more fold lines, or 'hinges'
    move at least a portion of the plane either above or below the rest of the plane
    not lengthen or shorten the distance on the paper between any two points
    
A fold introduces an arc along which one side of the fold may move relative to the other
A fold's hinge represents an axis of rotation about which a portion of the piece may be rotated WRT the rest of the piece

Folds have to happen in relation to landmarks, because you have to establish an axis of rotation between two co-planar points, and you need something to place those marks in relation to

On a blank sheet the landmarks are the corners; your first step is to bring two corners together
Landmarks are typically vertices or existing creases

Terms:
    fold
    crease
    corner
    
Ways to establish a fold axis:
    * vertex to meet vertex
    * vertex to meet point on line
    * line to meet line
    
How is a compound fold, like a squash fold, described?
    * orient the piece pre-fold
    * establish the end state of at least two landmarks
    * find the planar surfaces that connect the landmarks
    * bisect those surfaces to establish axes of rotation for the folds
    * rotate pieces individually
