Chapter 1: The Nature of Statistics

1.1 Statistics Defined
  * Two major branches:
    - descriptive: summarizing data, a picture of what is or what was
    - inductive: employs statistical inference to make guesses about an entire
      data set based on a population within that dataset

1.2 The Population and the Sample
  * "Population" -- the entirety of a dataset/the group to be studied.
    Represented by N.
  * "Variable" -- characteristics of members of the population
  * "Qualitative variable" -- categorical or nominal data
  * "Quantitative variable" -- discrete or continuous data
  * "Sample" -- a subset of the population, denoted n
  * "Representative sample" -- sample typical of the population in the
    attributes under study.

1.3 Selecting a Sample from a Population
  * Methods:
    - simple random sampling
    - with/without replacement
  * "Sampling error" -- natural variation in samples skews result
  * "Biased sample" -- sample that misrepresents the population in some way

1.4 Measurement Scales
  * Types:
    - nominal
    - ordinal
    - interval
    - ratio

1.5 Let Us Add
  * Introduces Sigma summation notation

Chapter 2: Analyzing Quantitative Data

2.1 Imposing Order
  * This chapter is about descriptive statistics

2.2 Tabular and Graphical Techniques: Ungrouped Data
  * Assume a sample of n observations on some variable X, denoted:

    X : X<sub>1</sub>, X<sub>2</sub>, ..., X<sub>n</sub>, i = 1, ..., n

  * "Absolute frequency distribution" -- Table of values and their frequencies
  * "Relative frequency distribution" -- each absolute frequency as a fraction
    of the total number of observations
  * "Percent distribution" -- relative frequencies * 100

2.3 Tabular and Graphical Techniques: Grouped Data
  * "Class frequency" -- frequency distribution after grouping data 
  * "Histogram" -- vertical bars with heights corresponding to a frequency dist

Chapter 3: Descriptive Characteristics of Quantitative Data

3.1 The Search for Summary Characteristics
  * "Parameter" -- any descriptive measure of a population
  * "Statistic" -- any descriptive measure of a sample
  * For a population, parameters are static. Statistics are variable, since they
    measure across a sample of the population.
  * Summary characteristics of a variable X:
    1. Measures of central location (describes a typical data value)
      a. Mean (unweighted or weighted)
      b. Quantiles (median and other measures of position)
      c. Mode
    2. Measures of dispersion (used to describe variation in a data set)
      a. Range and interquartile range
      b. Standard deviation
      c. Coefficient of variation
      d. Z-scores
    3. Measures of shape
      a. Coefficient of skewness
      b. Coefficient of kurtosis
    4. Measures which detect outliers

3.2 The Arithmetic Mean
  * Population mean:

             &Sum; X<sub>i</sub>
      &mu; = --------
                N

  * Sample mean:

      _   &Sum; X<sub>i</sub>
      X = -------
             n

  * Properties of the mean:
    1. The mean always exists.
    2. The mean is unique.
    3. The mean is affected by outliers.
    4. The mean is said to be "relatively reliable"--doesn't vary considerably
       under repeated sampling from the same population.
    5. Each observation used in the calculation of X-bar has the same weight

  * Weighted mean:

      _               &Sum; X<sub>i</sub> * w<sub>i</sub>
      X<sub>w</sub> = ---------
                      &Sum; w<sub>i</sub>


3.3 The Median
  * "Median" -- value that divides the observations of X into two equal parts
  * Rules for finding the median:
    
    1. Arrange the observations on a variable X in an increasing sequence.
    2.
      a. For an odd number of observations, take the middle term.
      b. For an even number, average the two middle terms.

  * Properties of the median:
    1. The median may or may not equal the mean.
    2. The median always exists.
    3. The median is unique.
    4. The median is not affected by outliers.

3.4 The Mode
  * "Mode" -- value that occurs with the highest frequency.
  * Samples can be modal (one mode), bimodal (two values tied for mode), etc.
  * Properties of the mode:
    1. The mode may or may not equal the mean and median.
    2. The mode may not exist.
    3. If the mode exists, it may not be unique.
    4. The mode is not affected by outliers.
    5. The mode always corresponds to an actual value of X.

3.5 The Range
  * "Range" -- max(X) - min(X)
  * Measures the total spread.

3.6 The Standard Deviation
  * The i-th deviation from the sample mean X-bar is X<sub>i</sub> - X-bar
  * The sum of all deviations from the mean is zero.
  * You square the deviations to avoid that zeroing, since they all become 
    positive numbers.
  * Population variance of X = average of the squared deviations from avg(X)
  * Variance generally:
