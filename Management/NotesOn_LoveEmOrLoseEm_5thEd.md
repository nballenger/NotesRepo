# A Prove Approach to Leading

* Four important words that drive the message
    * Love - Treat employees fairly and respectfully. Listen to them. Help them get what they want and need. Thank them. Challenge and develop them. Care about them, and you will engage and retain them.
    * Lose - Loss is just as serious when talent retires on the job as when they leave to join a competitior.
    * Good - Consider your solid citizens, not just your high-potentials. 
    * Stay - Encourage talented employees to stay with the enterprise (if not your own department). Talent will be the key differentiating factor in the competitive battle ahead.

# 1. Ask: What Keeps You?

* Too many leaders wait to ask "What can I do to keep you?" till an exit interview.
* At that point it's almost always too late.
* Ask early and often, help your people get more of what they want.
* Have 'stay interviews' to reduce turnover
* Managers dance around the question for one of three reasons:
    * Fear putting people on the spot / putting ideas in their heads
    * Afraid they won't be able to do anything anyway, so why ask?
    * Don't feel like they have the time to have those 1:1 discussions, because they're so urgently trying to 'produce'
* Risky to try to guess what people want and what will motivate them.
* Asking makes people feel cared about and important.
* Can be tricky to figure out when to ask. Give people a chance to prepare though.
* Set the context by telling people
    * how critical they are to you and your team
    * how important it is to you that they stay
* What if you can't give them what they want? Four steps:
    1. Restate how much you value them.
    1. Tell the truth about the obstacles you face in granting their requests.
    1. Show you care enough to look into their requests and advocate for them.
    1. Ask, "What else?"
* If they don't know what they want, set the stage for ongoing dialogue.
* If they don't trust you enough to tell you, try to find out why and purposly act in trust-building ways.
* If they question your motivation in asking, be honest about why you're asking.
* Things to do:
    * Ask each employee what will keep him or her at your company / department
    * Keep careful notes on what they say
    * Every month, review the notes and ask yourself what you've done for that employee that relates to their needs.
* Reasons most people give for staying, in frequency order, across 18k responses:
    1. Exciting, challenging, or meaningful work
    1. Supportive management / good boss
    1. Being recognized, valued, and respected
    1. Career growth, learning, and development
    1. Flexible work environment
    1. Fair pay
    1. Job location
    1. Job security and stability
    1. Pride in the organization, mission or product
    1. Working with great coworkers or clients
    1. Fun, enjoyable work environment
    1. Good benefits
    1. Loyalty and commitment to coworkers or boss
* What we know about pay:
    * Dissatisfaction rises if employees see compensation as:
        * noncompetitive
        * unfair
        * insufficient
    * Even fair pay won't keep people who are dissatisfied in other areas
    * Pay is a 'hygiene factor'--has to be there or people will notice
* To do:
    * Look back at list of reasons people stay, ask which you can influence
    * Check all those you believe are largely in your control
* Top 13 favorite 'stay interview' questions:
    1. What about your job makes you jump out of bed in the morning?
    1. What makes you hit the snooze button?
    1. If you were to win the lottery and resign, what would you miss most?
    1. What one change in your current role would make you consider leaving this job?
    1. If you had a magic wand, what would be the one thing you would change about this department, team, organization?
    1. As your manager, what could I do a little more of or a little less of?
    1. If you had to go back to a position in your past and stay for an extended period of time, which one would it be and why?
    1. What do you need to learn to work at your best?
    1. What makes for a great day?
    1. What can we do to make your job more satisfying?
    1. What can we do to support your career goals?
    1. Do you get enough recognition? How do you like to be recognized?
    1. What do you want to learn this year?
* Bottom line: stop guessing and ask your people what they need and want.

# 2: Buck: It Stops Here

* Question: Who's really in charge of engaging and retaining your best people?
* The factors that drive employee satisfaction, engagement, and commitment are much more related to managers than pay.
* To do:
    * Start a conversation, have a 'stay interview'. Keep that conversation going.
    * Hold 'Alas Clinics' to talk with others about talented people who've left, and how to keep people.
    * Think about who might be interested in leaving, and talk to them soon.
    * Look at the big picture, ask what kind of work environment you want to create
* Research indicates replacing employees can cost about 2x their salary, up to 4-5x for those with specialized skills.
* Managers should be held accountable for being _good managers_ and creating a retention culture where people feel motivated, cared about, and rewarded.
* Bottom line: the buck stops with you.

# 3: Careers: Support Growth

* Question: Are you helping build their future, or are you in the way?
* Having career opportunities is one of the primary reasons people stay and produce.
* Managers dodge career growth conversations for lots of reasons.
* Employees want two way conversations with you to talk about their abilities, choices, and ideas. They want to be heard, and have a dialogue.
* Steps you can take to build your talent pipeline and support your employees' search for a good career fit:
    1. Know their talents. - Ask about your employees unique skills, interests, and values. Hardest part is to listen as they answer, as a researcher would. Ask:
        * What makes you unique in this organization?
        * Tell me about one of your accomplishments that makes you proud.
        * What are your most important work-related values? Which are met at work? Which are not?
        * If you had to choose between working with people, data, things, or ideas, which mixture would be most satisfying? Why?
    1. Offer your perspective. - Help your employees reflect, give honest feedback. Development feedback is future oriented
    1. Discuss trends.
    1. Discover multiple options.
    1. Co-design an action plan.
