## Executive Summary

## Chapter Summaries

### Foreward (by Ken Wilber)

* Super buzzword-y, so much so I've never heard of most of these terms.
* "Postmodern" used on the first page, off to a rousing start.
* Takes a lot of words to say something like "there was a paradigm shift towards holism / syncretism / pluralism in the 70's and 80's."
* Sometimes postmodern stuff threw out the baby with the bathwater. Duh.
* There was _another_ paradigm shift! Surprise!
* "Where all the [previous ways of thinking about knowledge] felt that their truth and values were the only real truth and values in existence--all the others were mistaken, wrong, infantile, or just goofy--this new Integral stage somehow intuited that all of the previous value structures were true and important in their own ways, that all of them had something to offer, that all of them were 'true but partial.'"
* Foreward writer is talking about this book as being part of that--not just describing what came before, but being this new 'Integral' way of thinking.
* Bunch of stuff about "quadrants, levels, and lines" from the Foreward writer's work on 'Integral Theory'
* Integral theory is an attempt at a 'Comprehensive Map of human makeup'
* Five basic dimensions in the framework:
    * **quadrants** - four major perspectives through which phenomena can be examined: "the interior and the exterior in the individual and the collective."
        * Interior of individual is an "I" space, includes subjective experiences
        * Interior of collective is a "we" space, includes intersubjective shared values/norms/etc.
        * Exterior of individual is an "it" space, includes objective facts and data about the individual
        * Exterior of collective is an "its" space, includes interobjective systems, processes, relationships, etc.
    * **lines of development** - lines along which an organization or individual can develop. Examples: cognitive, emotional, moral, values, needs, spirituality.
    * **levels of development** - relative or nominal markers for noting the state of development along a line ("Suzy is at level blue for emotion, and level orange for values")
    * **states of consciousness**
    * **types**
* Lots of stuff from what I'm guessing is developmental psychology.
* Here we go--you could cut most of the rest of the foreward and just read this paragraph: 

> "As Elliott Jacques' works have empirically demonstrated, the way most organizations are structured, those at the lower levels of this hierarchy usually work on the floor or assembly line; those at the intermediate levels mostly work middle management; and those at the upper levels work upper management (including CEO, CFO, COO). What these newer organizations do is move all of these levels--the entire hierarchy itself--into teams of usually 10 to 15 people. Any person, in any team, can make literally any decision for the company--and, in fact, virtually all the major decisions in the organization are made by team members--including sales, marketing, hiring and recruitment, research and development, salary decisions, dismissals, HR functions, equipment purchases, community relations, and so on. This makes each team, and each person in the team, much more Integral--they can operate on any level in the hierarchy they are capable of, as long as they consult with those who will be affected by the decision (although they don't have to follow the advice), where previously they had been constrained by their place in the pyramid. **One of the great findings of Laloux's work is that actualization hierarchies can flourish when dominator hierarchies are removed. A company of 500 individuals thus has, not one but 500 CEO, any one of whom might have a breakthrough idea and be able to implement it, a true self-management move that is one of the major reasons for the astonishing success of so many of these organizations. What happens to middle and much of upper management? Mostly, it doesn't exist. Those hierarchies have been relocated.**"

### Introduction: The Emergence of a New Organizational Model

* Talks about misconception that we have a single brain; we have at least three (biologically): head (large), one in the heart, and one in the gut. Gut brain discovered in 1860's, basically forgotten by medicine until 1990's. 
* "How could medical circles forget the existence of a brain? I believe it has to do with the belief system of our times: in a hierarchical worldview, there can be only one brain in command, just as there must be a single boss at the head of every organization. [...] The age of the internet has precipitated a new worldview--one that can contemplate the possibility of distributed intelligence instead of top-down hierarchy."

#### The limits of our current organizational models

* "[C]ould it be that our current worldview limits the way we think about organizations? Could we invent a more powerful, more soulful, more meaningful way to work together, if only we change our belief system?"
* Gives examples of approaches to large problems that have scaled due to distributed strategies (some unintentional): networks of hospitals, schools, non-profits. (Not actually much more detailed than just listing them.)
* **Posits that life tends to suck on both ends of a hierarchical system. Lots of quiet suffering on everybody's part.**

#### The questions that triggered the research for this book

* Organizational change programs tend to make things worse.
* What would truly different, radical thinking about the problem look like?
* **"What we need is faith that it can be done and answers to some very concrete questions."**
    * If not hierarchy, what structure?
    * How does decision-making happen productively?
    * How do you keep politics from poisoning it all?
    * Etc.

#### Organizations over the course of the evolution (Part 1)

* Talks about Einstein saying you can't fix problems with the same kind of consciousness that created them--we need a change in consciousness to fix this.
* "There is one important aspect that researchers have so far somewhat overlooked: every time humanity has shifted to a new stage, it has invented a new way to collaborate, a new organizational model."
* Developmental psych has a lot to say about transitioning to a new state of consciousness. So presumably we'll be seeing more of that as the book goes on.
* **"This next stage involves taming our ego and searching for more authentic, more wholesome ways of being. If the past is any guide to the future, then as we grow into the next stage of consciousness, we will also develop a corresponding organizational model."**

#### Empirical research -- what pioneers can teach us (Part 2)

* Spent two years studying organizations he believes have already "started operating on a new organizational model consistent with the next stage of human development."
* Questions he was trying to answer while looking at these orgs:
    * _What do organizations molded around the next stage consciousness look and feel like?_
    * _Is it already possible to describe their structures, practices, process, and cultures (in other words, to conceptualize the organizational model) in useful detail, to help other people set up similar organizations?_
* Criteria for selecting organizations:
    * Can come from any geographical area
    * Can come from any subject domain
    * Need to employ minimum 100 people
    * Must have been operating for at least 5 years using structures, practices, processes, cultures consistent with the characteristics of the next developmental stage.
* Selected 12 organizations, many much larger than 100, much longer than 5 years.
* Organizations turned out not to know about each other, despite similarities.
* Two big sets of questions (in appendix 1)
    * Related to practices/processes common to organizational research:
        * "key overarching organizational processes such as strategy, marketing, sales, operations, budgeting, and controlling"
        * "the main human resource processes, including recruitment, training, evaluation, compensation"
        * "critical practices of everyday life like meetings, information flow, and office spaces"
    * Question set two is about how to replicate successes, not explained in detail here.

#### Spoiler Alert

* The stories of each org could be their own books. Author more interested in whether there are repeating commonalities that could be a template for a new model.
* **It did appear to be the case that there was a lot of convergence in structures and practices, despite the organizations not knowing of each other.**
* This is early research, but seems positive.

#### Necessary conditions (Part 3)

* The third part of the book is about how to replicate success with these patterns.

### Chapter 1.1: Changing Paradigms: Past and Present Organizational Models

* "It turns out that, throughout history, the types of organizations we have invented were tied to the prevailing worldview and consciousness. Every time that we, as a species, have changed the way we think about the world, we have come up with more powerful types of organizations."
* Developmental psychologists and others who've done previous work around these questions:
    * Maslow - how human needs evolve along the human journey, from basic physiological needs to self-actualization.
    * Gebser, et al. - how 'worldviews' shape development
    * Piaget - 'cognitive capacities'
    * Graves - 'values'
    * Kohlberg, Gilligan - 'moral development'
    * Loevinger - 'self-identity'
    * Fowler - spirituality
    * Cook-Greuter, Kegan, Torbert - 'leadership'
* "In their exploration, they found consistently that humanity evolves in stages."
* Ken Wilber and Jenny Wade have compared / contrasted available models of staged development, have found strong convergence. Essentially the models redescribe the same territory in different terms and through different lenses.
* "Every transition to a new stage of consciousness has ushered n a whole new era in human history. [...] One aspect hasn't yet received much attention: with every new stage in human consciousness also came a breakthrough in our ability to collaborate, bringing about a new organizational model."
* Chapter gives a tour of the major stages of human consciouness and corresponding organizational models.
* Will refer to every stage / model with a name and color, since some people find the color-coding very memorable.

#### Reactive--Infrared paradigm

* Span of 100,000 to 50,000 BC
* Lived in small bands of family kinships, couple dozen people.
* Complexity in relationships is very limited.
* Ego is not fully formed; people don't perceive themselves as entirely distinct from others or from the environment.
* **No real division of labor other than childbearing, so no real organizational model at this stage.**

#### Magic--Magenta paradigm

* ~15,000 years ago, shift from Reactive to Magical stage of consciousness
* Tribes of up to a few hundred people.
* Major step up in complexity psychologically and cognitively.
* Self is largely differentiated physically and emotionally from others, but still fairly solipsistic.
* Cause and effect only sketchily understood, gives rise to ritualistic behavior, following elders / shamans.
* Cognitively: no abstraction, no classification, no concept of large numbers
* **Organizations don't exist at this stage; task differentiation extremely limited though some authority vests in elders.**

#### Impulsive--Red paradigm

* ~10,000 years ago, shift from extended tribes to first chiefdoms and proto-empires
* Saw first forms of organizational life ('Red Organizations')
* Ego now fully created, sense of self entirely differentiated
* Recognition of the possibility of death, danger
* Recognition of possibility for positional power
* Emotional complexity is low: needs expressed through tantrums and violence
* Little orientation toward others' theory of mind
* **Ego-differentiation == role differentiation == meaningful division of labor:  Chief and foot soldiers, slavery, conquering / subjugating adjoining people**
* **"Impulsive-Red is highly suitable for hostile environments: combat zones, civil wars, failed states, prisons, or violent inner-city neighborhoods."**

##### Red Organizations

* Initial appearance as small conquering armies, proto-empires.
* Currently found as street gangs and mafias--borrow tools from modernity (weapons, infotech, etc.), but structures and practices are largely still Impulsive-Red.
* Defining characteristics:
    * Continuous exercise of power in interpersonal relationships
    * Stability provided by chief surrounding self with family members
    * No formal hierarchy, no job titles.
* Impulsive-Red organizations don't scale well--rarely manage to keep people in line who are separated from the chief by more than three or four degrees.
* Can be powerful if conditions are dangerous enough, but are inherently fragile due to impulsivity (want == take) of members.
* Poor at planning due to focus on the present
* Highly reactive to threats and opportunities, do well in chaotic conditions.

#### Conformist--Amber paradigm

* Transition from tribal world with horticulture to "agriculture, states and civilizations, institutions, bureaucracies, and organized religions."
* **"According to developmental psychologiests, a large share of today's adult population in developed societies operates from this paradigm."**
* Features:
    * Reality understood rationally; cause and effect are understood
    * Conception of linear time, projection of self into the future
    * Greater awareness of the feelings and perceptions of others.
* "People at this stage internalize group norms, and the thinking is dominated by whether one has the right appearance, behaviors, and thoughts to fit in. The dualistic thinking of Red is still present, but the individual 'my way or your way' is replaced with a collective 'us or them.' Red egocentrism has given way to Amber ethnocentrism."
* The self can exercise self-discipline and self-control in public and private.
* **"Worldview is static: there are immutable laws that make for a just world, where things are either right or wrong. [...] People internalize the rules and morality and feel guilt and shame when they go astray. Authority to define what is right and wrong is now linked to a role, rather than to a powerful personality"**
* **Because causality, linear time, and theory of mind are all scary, the Amber ego looks for order, stability and predictability.**
* Creates institutions, bureaucracies, roles, identities to serve those ends.

##### Amber Organizations

* Two major breakthroughs at this stage:
    * Organizations can plan form medium and long term; and
    * can create organizational structures that are stable and scale
* Allows huge outcomes not available to Red organizations.
* Still very present today: government agencies, public schools, religious institutions, the military

##### Amber breakthrough 1: Long-term perspective (stable processes)

* Long-term perspective linked to the invention of processes that allow replication of previous successes like "last year's harvest"
* Critical knowledge no longer depends on a single person, it becomes embedded in the organization.
* Replacement of individuals in roles allows succession over long periods of time.
* Individuals tend to view change with suspicion, and operate on a base assumption that there is one right way of doing things.
* Adapt poorly to the need for change, do not work well in competition due to belief in One Right Way.
* Tend to strive for dominance/monopoly.

##### Amber breakthrough 2: Size and Stability (formal hierarchies)

* Power is stabilized through titles, fixed hierarchies, org charts.
* Structure becomes pyramidal, with cascade of reporting lines
* Allegiance is to the next rung, not necessarily the cheif, so lines of control can be much longer.
* "Planning and execution are strictly separated: the thinking happens at the top, the doing at the bottom. [...] The constant threat of violece from above in Red Organizations gives way to more subtle and elaborate control mechanisms."

> "The underlying worldview [of Amber Organizations] is that workers are mostly lazy, dishonest, and in need of direction. They must be supervised and told what is expected of them. Participatory management seems foolish from a Conformist-Amber perspective; management must rely on command and control to achieve results. Jobs at the frontlines are narrow and routine-based. Innovation, critical thinking, and self-expression are not asked for (and often discouraged). Information is shared on an as-needed basis. People are effectively interchangeable resources; individual talent is neither discerned nor developed."

* It represents a considerable improvement on Red Organizations--to stay safe, you only need to follow the rules.

##### The social mask

* Individuals become identified with their roles / place in the organization
* Titles and ranks bolster role identification
* Putting on symbols of rank and role involves putting on a specific social mask
* **"Social stability comes at the price of wearing a mask, of learning to distance ourselves from our unique nature, from our personal desires, needs, and feelings; instead, we embrace a socially acceptable self."**

##### Us versus them

* Social belonging is extremely important in the Conformist-Amber paradigm
* Amber Organizations are definitively siloed, and groups are suspicious of each other.
* They try to restore trust by creating procedures and rules for going across silo boundaries.
* There is a very large barrier between the organization and the outside world. Amber Orgs try to be self-contained and autonomous.
* Leads to vertical integration, a sense that employees 'belong' to the organization. Dismissal is a lost of both identity and the social fabric.
* People leaving an Amber Organization may be seen as betrayers, and may feel they are leaving a life behind them.

#### Achievement--Orange paradigm

* The world is not a fixed universe with immutable laws, but a complex mechanism that can be investigated and understood.
* No absolute right and wrong, though some things are more effective. "Effectiveness replaces morals as a yardstick for decision-making"
* Allows questioning of authority, group norms, inherited status quo.
* Arguably the dominating worldview of most current leaders in business and politics.
* Dark side(s): "corporate greed, political short-termism, overleverage, overconsumption, and the reckless exploitation of the planet's resources and ecosystems."
* Enormously liberating though, to be able to question authority.
* Red = Egocentric, Amber = Ethnocentric, Orange = 'Worldcentric'
* Orange idealizes a real meritocracy, but doesn't fully deconstruct the Amber world of social conventions and stratification.
* Worldview is very materialistic--what can be seen and touched is real.
* "In Orange, we effectively live in the future, consumed by mental chatter about the things we need to do so as to reach the goals we have set for ourselves."

##### Orange Organizations

* Modern global corporations use structures, practices, and cultures inspired by Achievement-Orange worldview.
* Surpass what Amber organizations can achieve due to three breakthroughs: innovation, accountability, and meritocracy.

##### Orange breakthrough 1: Innovation

* "Amber Organizations are entirely _process_ driven; Orange Organizations are _process and project_ driven."
* They retain a basic pyramid structure, but start using project groups to cross silo and hierarchy boundaries, speed up communication, and foster innovation.

##### Orange breakthrough 2: Accountability

* "Amber _command and control_ becomes Orange _predict and control_."
* More of the organization should be empowered to think and execute, to gain competitive advantages.
* Top management formulates direction, cascades down objectives to get to a desired outcome.
* Epitomized as "I don't care how you do it, just get it done."
* Incentive programs become common--Orange uses more carrots, fewer sticks.
* Both managers and employees experience more freedom, and well designed incentive programs can reduce adversarial relationships by focusing on common benefits.
* Unfortunately, often ego and fear undermine the good intention. "[I]n practice, leaders' fear to give up control trumps their ability to trust, and they keep making decisions high up that would be better left in the hands of people lower in the hierarchy."

##### Orange breakthrough 3: Meritocracy

* Ideally, anybody can move up the ladder, and nobody is destined to stay in one position.
* Huge breakthrough in social fairness. In principle gives people the option to choose the occupation that suits their talents and aspirations.
* Tends to do away with the symbols of hierarchy--uniforms become generic business dress.
* People tend to wear a professional mask, rather than a positional one.

##### Organizations as machines

* Achievement-Orange sees organizations as machines.
* Sounds very impersonal, but also demonstrates dynamism compared to Amber Organizations' rigid, unchanging rules and hierarchies.
* Can feel very lifeless and soulless.
* Each paradigm has a worldview suited leadership style:
    * Impulsive-Red - predatory 
    * Conformist-Amber - paternalistic authoritarian
    * Achievement-Orange - goal-oriented, putting tasks over relationships

##### The shadows of Orange

* 'Innovation gone mad' -- drive for growth == need to create artificial desire for consumption
* When success is measured in terms of money and recognition, people experience a sense of emptiness, of being slowly ground down.
* Individual and collective greed.

#### Pluralistic-Green paradigm

* Sees Achievement-Orange's focus on "what works and what doesn't" as too simplistic.
* Is very aware of the shadow Orange casts on real human experience.
* Highly sensitive to feelings, attempts equal respect for every perspective.
* "It seeks fairness, equality, harmony, community, cooperation, and consensus. The self operating from this perspective strives to belong, to foster close and harmonious bonds with everyone."
* Wants to break down not just bonds of conventional roles, but entire edifice of social classes, patriarchy, structuralism.
* Really gained currency in the 20th century West.
* Very present in postmodern academic thinking, nonprofits, social workers, community activists.
* "For people operating from this perspective, relationships are valued above outcomes. [...] Pluralistic-Green strives for bottom-up processes, gathering input from all and trying to bring opposing points of view to eventual consensus."
* Contains obvious contradictions--wants to respect all viewpoints, but that tolerance is easily abused.
* Viewed as idealistic by Red/Amber/Orange
* Relationship to rules is conflicted: rules always end up being arbitrary, but having no rules opens the doors for abuse.
* "Green is powerful as a paradigm for breaking down old structures, but often less effective at formulating practical alternatives."

##### Green Organizations

* Uneasy with power and hierarchy, occasionally will try to abolish them.
* "[Co-ops and communes] have not been successful on a meaningful scale for any meaningful amount of time."
* Consensus is a very hard process to manage, often ends in stalemate. That leads to power manipulation behind the scenes, to get things moving again.
* While the extremes of egalitarianism don't seem to work, Green has its own organizational model, and a number of companies like Southwest Airlines, Ben &amp; Jerry's, The Container Store, are run on Green practices and culture.

##### Green breakthrough 1: Empowerment

* Has meritocracy, but also pushes a majority of decision-making to frontline workers who are in touch with day to day problems.
* Managers are asked to share power and give up some control, which isn't easy.
* Companies who make it work have to very clearly spell out what kind of leadership they expect from management.
* Green leaders should be "servant leaders" in order to hear and empower subordinates.
    * Management candidates are screened for ability to share power, lead with humility
    * Orgs often invest a large amount in training for new managers, to teach them the mindset/skills they'll need
    * Managers evaluated on 360-degree feedback, to make them accountable to their subordinates
    * Sometimes management is chosen by subordinates rather than using appointment from above.

##### Green breakthrough 2: Values-driven culture and inspirational purpose

* Empowered organizations need a strong, shared culture to hold together
* Frontline employees are guided by shared values, rather than a rulebook
* Orange organizations often adopt the terminology of shared values without actually living them, devaluing the idea for many individuals.
* Real Green Organizations can have "incredibly vibrant cultures in which employees feel appreciated and empowered to contribute."
* HR is elevated to a central role due to focus on company culture.

##### Green breakthrough 3: Multiple stakeholder perspective

* Green organizations attempt to put stakeholders and shareholders on equal footing.
* "The role of leadership is to make the right tradeoffs so that all stakeholders can thrive."

##### Family as the guiding metaphor

* Orange sees organizations as machines; Green sees them as families.

#### From Red to Green: co-existence of organizational models

* Change appears to be speeding up.
* May see more than one stage beyond Green during our lifetimes.
* "Never before in human history have we had people operating from so many different paradigms all living alongside each other."
* Generalizing about developed societies:
    * Impulsive-Red - fringes of legal activity
    * Conformist-Amber - Government agencies, military, religious orgs, public schools
    * Achievement-Orange - business corporations
    * Pluralistic-Green - nonprofits, some businesses

### Chapter 1.2: About Stages of Development

* This section is a pause before discussioning 'Evolutionary-Teal'
* Aims to clarify some things about human evolution, since "[s]ometimes, when people are first exposed to the notion of successive stages in human evolution, they are so fascinating with the insight that they tend to apply it haphazardly, oversimplifying reality to fit the model. Other people have the opposite reaction; they feel uncomfortable with a model that could be used to label people and put them into different boxes."
* Misconception: that successive stages in development might imply some people are somehow better than others. A more helpful interpretation is that later stages are not 'better' but simply more complex ways of dealing with the world.
* Every level has pros and cons, and its own complexities.
* Also recognize that each stage is well adapted to a context--viz. Red-Impulsive being useful in extreme chaos.

#### The complexity of human evolution

* The stages and colors are only an abstraction of a complex underlying reality.
* Movement from one stage to another is not simple or necessarily linear.
* "Every paradigm _includes and transcends_ the previous." Even if you're working regularly in Achievement-Orange, you can still react with Impulsive-Red patterns.
* "There are many dimensions of human development and we don't necessarily grow at the same pace in all of them." You could be Orange in your work life and Amber in your spiritual life.
* On saying "that person is Green" (or Amber/Orange/Red): "At best we can say that in a specific moment a person 'operates from' one type of paradigm."
* **Useful analogy: "If evolution were music, stages of development would be musical notes, vibrating at certain frequencies. Human beings would be like strings, capable of playing many different notes. The range of notes they can play depends on the range of tensions they have learned to accommodate."**
* People operating from the same stage can have wildly different beliefs and viewpoints.
* "We can develop _vertically_ by integrating a perspective from a later stage, but there is just as much room to develop _horizontally__ within a stage--say, from an intolerant and narrow-minded to a generous and open-minded expression of Amber."

#### Shifting stages

* "According to the research, the trigger for vertical growth always comes in the form of a major life challenge that cannot be resolved from the current worldview."
* Can happen when the norms of multiple groups you are allied with fall into conflict.
* You can't force anybody to change this way, though you can create environments conducive to growth and surround people with peers who are already there.

#### Stage development applied to organizations

* When talking about an organization being at one stage or another, we're talking about systems/culture/processes, not people.
* You can look at an issue, say compensation, and place it in a specific worldview. If you look at all the various issues, you'll see they cluster around a center of gravity.
* Different units or locations in an organization can have different centers of gravity (headquarters is Orange, manufacturing plants are Amber, for example).

#### The pull of leadership--downward and upward

* The stage of an organization is determined by the stage through which its leadership tends to view the world.
* "[A]n organization cannot evolve beyond its leadership's stage of development."
* Example: Orange organizations may feel they need mission statements or lists of values, but those only really make sense in Pluralistic-Green--Orange leaders and organizations will choose profit over values very predictably.
* Leaders can pull back practices from later stages, or pull forward on previous stage practices.
* "[T]he true genius of organizations: they can lift groups of people to punch above their weight, to achieve outcomes they could not have achieved on their own."

### Chapter 1.3 Evolutionary-Teal

* Next stage corresponds to Maslow's "self-actualizing" level; labeled 'authentic', 'integral', or 'Teal'
* It's the last stage of the hierarchy of needs, and researchers often think of it as being such a big shift that it is 'second tier' while all previous stages are 'first tier'
* First-tier stages consider that their worldview is the only valid one, other people being dangerously mistaken. People transitioning to Teal can recognize that stages of consciousness exist, that there is momentum in evolution, etc.

#### Taming the fears of the ego

* Each shift occurs when we can reach a vantage point that gives broader perspective.
* "The shift to Evolutionary-Teal happens when we learn to disidentify from our own ego. [...] In the process, we make room to listen to the wisdom of other, deeper parts of ourselves."
* "What replaces fear? A capacity to _trust the abundance of life_."
* Lets you operate from trust and abundance rather than fear and scarcity.

#### Inner rightness as compass
