ISBN 9781942788331

# Preface

* Starting in 2013, looked at what capabilities and practices are important to accelerate development and delivery of software. Results come in terms of profitability, productivity, and market share, and non-financial outcomes of effectiveness, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.
* Research conducted using cross-sectional studies. Same methods are used in healthcare research, workplace research, and memory research. Research methods covered in depth in Part II.

## The Research

* 23k survey responses, internationally, from 2k unique organizations of varying sizes.
* Looked at startups and internet companies, as well as highly regulated industries like finance, healthcare, and government. Both legacy and greenfield development considered.
* Findings should apply independent of your particular development methodology, since it's an exercise in start-where-you-are, continuous improvement.

## The Joureney and the Data

* Genesis for research is a compelling curiosity for "what makes high-performing technology organizations great, and how software makes organizations better."
* Authors:
    * Nicole Forsgren, PhD in Management Information Systems, researched the factors that make tech impactful in organizations.
    * Jez Humble, coauthor of 'Continuous Delivery', 'Lean Enterprise', and 'The DevOps Handbook'.
    * Gene Kim , has been studying high performing tech orgs since 1999.
* Book covers 4 years of research findings, 2014 through 2017
* Each year they mailed invitations to mailing lists, and leveraged social media, to target professionals working in tech. 
* Particular focus on software development and delivery paradigms, and DevOps
* Data came from surveys

## 2014: Laying the Foundation. Delivery Performance and Organizational Performance

* Key research questions in first year:
    * What does it mean to delivery software, and can it be measured?
    * Does software delivery impact organizations?
    * Does culture matter, and how do we measure it?
    * What technical practices appear to be important?
* Discoveries in first year:
    * Software development and delivery can be statistically measured
    * High performers do it in consistently good ways that are significantly better than other companies
    * Throughput and stability move together
    * An organization's ability to make software positively impacts profitability, productivity, and market share.
    * Culture and technical practices matter, and are measurable.
* Revised methodology: moved from yes/no questions to Likert questions

## 2015: Extending the Work and Deepening the Analysis

* Research is about iteration, incremental improvement, and revalidation of important results
* Goals in year two were to revalidate and confirm some key findings, and extend the model
* Research questions:
    * Can we revalidate that software delivery impacts organizational performance?
    * Do technical practices and automation impact software delivery?
    * Do lean management practices impact software delivery?
    * Do technical practices and Lean management practices impact aspects of work that affect our workforce--such as anxiety associated with code deployments and burnout?
* Hypotheses were supported, confirming and extending work from year 1.

## 2016: Expanding our Look into Technical Practices and Exploring the Fuzzy Front End

* Looked at significance of additional technical practices, like security, trunk-based development, and test data management.
* Expanded investigation upstream, to see if they could measure the impact of the current move away from traditional project management practices to applying Lean principles in product management.
