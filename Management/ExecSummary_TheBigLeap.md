# Executive Summary: The Big Leap

My biggest issue with this book is that it takes an essentially socialist premise and attempts to make it work via the language of capitalism. If everybody has worth, has something in them that is their joyful 'Zone of Genius,' and each of us seeking that out is an inherent good, then we should shape our society around making that possible. Trying to do it in a hyper-competitive, devil take the hindmost capitalist system is just stupid.

## Criticisms of the Book

_Note: If you never intend to read the actual book, you can ignore this section._

For the record, I think there are ideas in _The Big Leap_ well worth exploring. I've tried to distill those into the summary above. I can't recommend the source text whole-heartedly however, as I found that some of the specifics of its language can distract from the core of quality material at the book's heart. Therefore if you do intend to read it, it may help to be aware of the following in advance:

* The book is clearly written to sell to a fairly specific audience, and may feel difficult to identify with (or even alienating) for people outside that audience. It's pitched to appeal to executives and others who typically already have a fair amount of personal and financial agency in their lives. As a result, the personal stories and narrative examples in the book tend to revolve around less-than-universal topics like golf, affairs with secretaries, or disappointing one's wealthy family members.
* For reasons probably linked to the book's target audience, there are some visible but unquestioned assumptions that can feel jarringly inconsistent. For instance, despite a strong thematic focus on how emotional satisfaction can and should outweigh accumulating material posessions, there are constant mentions of "increased wealth" and "financial success" as self-evidently important personal goals.
* Despite having a background as a Ph.D. and university professor, the author seems very willing to make health claims without reference to studies or data that support his intuitions. For instance, he says things like:

    > When people are not expressing their full potential, they often get illnesses that have vague, hard-to-diagnose symptoms. Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia are good examples of what I'm describing. (p. 32)

* The book leans into a troubling pattern I've observed in other popular psychology and self-help literature: if you read it and experience success, it's attributable to the author's wisdom--but if you fail, that's evidence of some intrinsic deficiency within you. For instance, in the section 'Focusing On You,' he says:

    > When you consider the possiblity of consistently feeling good and having things go well in your life all the time, you may find yourself thinking, "That's not possible." If so, I understand. I once felt that way, too. I urge you, though, not to waste much of your precious time worrying about whether it's possible. I've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that it _is_. The only relevant question is whether _you_ will let it be possible for _you_. (p. 15)

* The model of conflict resolution the author seems to favor (p. 87-9) involves all parties claiming responsibility for the conflict's existence, and working towards a mutually agreeable outcome. This is workable in some scenarios, but betrays blind spots around a) conflicts involving structural power imbalances (landlord vs. renter, owner vs. employee), and b) conflicts which truly represent a zero sum game (criminal defense trials). It feels like everyone the author describes using these methods can simply walk away from conflicts that don't interest them.
* The author says there is a "huge fear" underneath each person's personal narrative about why they can't take their Big Leap: _"If I took the Big Leap into my Zone of Genius, I might fail. What if I really opened up to my true genius and found that my genius wasn't good enough?"_ What he _doesn't_ do however is examine the societal context that fear is rooted in for Americans, where we have little to no social safety net, healthcare tied to employment, and enormous stigma attached to poverty. Looking at the demotivating aspects of fear without acknowledging the very real dangers of taking professional risks seems short-sighted. I suspect the author's personal financial status blinds him to most Americans' realities.

Again, I don't think these points undermine the usefulness of ideas like 'Upper Limit Problems,' or the 'Zone of Genius.' If you find value in the full text, that's great! I only include them here because I found them noticeable enough to be distracting, and I thought others might as well.
