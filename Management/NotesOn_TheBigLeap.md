# Notes on The Big Leap: Conquer Your Hidden Fear and Take Life to the Next Level

By Gay Hendricks; HarperCollins, 2009; ISBN 978-0-06-187276-1

# Introduction: Remove Your Last Obstacle to Ultimate Success in Wealth, Work, and Love

## The One Problem that Holds You Back

* 'The Upper Limit Problem' - identify and transcend your own 'Upper Limit', which is posited as a key skill to develop via the book
* Theory is that there's only one problem you need to solve, but it's one you don't actually know about.
* Passing references to capitalized terms: Upper Limit, Big Leap

## The Moment of Discovery

* Story:
    * Working, daughter away at a summer program
    * Having a good day, then suddenly hit by images of daughter having a bad time, being lonely, not fitting in, etc.
    * Calls up dorm leader, is assured daughter is in fact fine.
    * Dorm leader says lots of parents do that, because "You don't realize how much _you_ miss _her_, so you think _she_ must be hurting somehow. Plus you probably had experiences yourself of being lonely away from home, so you think she must be having the same experience."
    * Q: "How did I go from feeling good in one moment to manufacturing a stream of painful images in the next?"
    * A: "I manufactured the stream of painful images _because_ I was feeling good! [...] When I reached my Upper Limit of how much positive feeling I could handle, I created a series of unpleasant thoughts to deflate me. The thoughts I manufactured were guaranteed to make me return to a state I was more familiar with: not feeling so good."
* Pattern emerges: enjoy a period of feeling really good, then self sabotage
* Extrapolates it to societal problems: cycles of expansion/recession, peace and war
* Needed to state the problem to solve, questions to answer
* Problem as formulated by the author:

    > I have a limited tolerance for feeling good. When I hit my Upper Limit, I manufacture thoughts that make me feel bad. The problem is bigger than just my internal feelings though: I seem to have a limited tolerance for my life going well in general. When I hit my Upper Limit, I do something that stops my positive forward trajectory. I get into a conflict with my ex-wife, get into a money bind, or do something else that brings me back down within the bounds of my limited tolerance.

* Questions:
    * Primary: "How can I extend the periods of contentment in my life?"
    * "If I can eliminate the behaviors that stop the flow of positive energy, can I learn how to feel great all the time?"
    * "Can I allow things to go well in my life all the time? In relationships, can I live in harmony and intimacy all the time?"
    * "Can our species live in expanding waves of peace and prosperity, free from the pattern of messing things up when they are going well?"

# Chapter 1: Preparing for Your Big Leap: The One Problem and How to Solve It

## How to Begin

* Answer four questions, starting with the fundamental one: 

    > Am I willing to increase the amount of time every day that I feel good inside?

* Feel good in this instance is an inner sense of well-being that's not dependent on outside factors.
* Question extended to outer aspects of life: 

    > Am I willing to increase the amount of time that my whole life goes well?

* Referencing work, relationships, creative pursuits, other things central to you.
* Taking it a step further:

    > Am I willing to feel good and have my life go well all the time?

* "In my life I've discovered that if I cling to the notion that something's not possible, I'm arguing in favor of limitation. And if I argue for my limitations, I get to keep them. Ultimately we have to ask ourselves, 'What's the payoff for arguing forcefully for our limitations?'"
* "In the face of so much evidence that life hurts and is fraught with adversity on all fronts, having a willingness to feel good and have life go well all the time is a genuinely radical act."
* Additional question, if you accept the previous ones:

    > Are you willing to take the Big Leap to your ultimate level of success in love, money, and creative contribution?

## Maynard's Big Leap

* Example of Maynard Webb, who was COO of eBay at the time
* Author says he was operating in his Zone of Excellence, but not Zone of Genius
* Webb was willing to confront the Upper Limit Problem and make a Big Leap into his Zone of Genius.
* He started a new company, Live Ops
* Contrast his story to Dr. Richard Jordan, who had created a small business that was being offered a $3M acquisition
* He was on the verge of a deal but sabotaged it by arguing over the details of his vacation.
* After several years of introspection, he decided that he was saying "that money is way more than I'm worth, and I can't allow this."
* He formed two questions to use going forward:
    1. How much love and abundance am I willing to allow?
    1. How am I getting in my own way?
* He sold the business to somebody else and made money. Yay?

## Focusing on You

* Why might one resist saying yes to the questions above? Author posits you don't think it's possible, but then says he's proved it is.
* Says the only relevant question is whether you will let it be possible for you. Which of course is the self help trick of putting success on him, and failure on the reader. "You didn't let yourself see the genius of my work, too bad."
* "Speaking personally, I found that my biggest resistance was the fear of owning my full potential. As I explored this fear, I realized that making such a big commitment put everything on the line. It eliminated any excuse I'd ever allowed myself for failing to achieve what I set out to do."
* Says it is likely that your ego will use fear to keep you from moving toward your Zone of Genius, where (presumably via flow state or some such) you achieve a sort of ego-less state.

## The Way Through

* To get through the fog of fear you have to transform it into the clarity of exhilaration.
* Fritz Perls, founder of Gestalt therapy, said: "Fear is excitement without the breath."
* Author says it implies that any fear can be transformed into excitement by breathing fully with it, and excitement can be turned to fear by holding your breath.
* The less breath you feed your fear, the bigger it gets.
* "The goal in life is not to attain some imaginary ideal; it is to find and fully use our own gifts."

## Moving Beyond the Hardest Part

* Saying yes to the Big Leap is the hardest part.

## How the Upper Limit Problem Works

* We all have a set of limits for how much love, success, creativity we allow ourselves to enjoy. If we exceed those limits, we self sabotage to get back to a place where we feel secure.
* A lot of those limits get set in childhood, and then keep us from enjoying a bunch of love, creativity, and money later. Keeps you in zones of Competence or at best Excellence, but prevents movement to zone of genius.
* If you make a spectacular leap in one are of your life, your upper limit problem gives you guilt that makes you unable to enjoy your new abundance.
* In childhood, the upper limit problem develops in "acts of misguided altruism," specifically attempts to take care of the feelings of others.

## A Radical Idea

* Guilt shows up when you're feeling good, and you come up against an old belief like "I must not feel good, because fundamentally flawed people like me don't deserve it."
* You can gradually expand your capacity for enjoyment.
* Common idea is that you will feel good when you finally have more X, where X is money, better relationships, more creativity. In fact that's the wrong way around--nurturing a capacity for positive feelings allows you to have an abundance of those things.
* If you focus you can find some place in you that feels good. If you give that place your full attention you can expand it. Let yourself enjoy that as long as you can stand to.
* If you can't find a good place internally to appreciate on some topic, create a positive thought and focus on that.

## The Upper Limit Thermostats of Famous and Highly Successful People

* Uses Bill Clinton as an example--took himself to the White House, then self sabotaged by getting involved with an intern. [That seems like a pretty specious example.]
* [I'm not sure these examples are particularly well thought through. Belushi's self destruction seems maybe the most amenable, but still, it's a pretty thin gloss on his situation.]

## Solving One Problem and Freeing Yourself

* Upper Limit Problem is unsolvable in your ordinary state of consciousness, only solvable via a 'leap of consciousness.'
* Cannot be solved in the usual way we solve problems: "by gathering information or replacing one set of information with another."
* Our activities in the world occur in four main zones. [pretty weak transition]

### The Zone of Incompetence

* Activities we're not good at; others can do them better than we can.
* Best way to handle most things in this zone is to avoid doing them.
* It can be easy to get stuck in this zone sometimes.
* Worthwhile to do something you're not good at if the intention is to enjoy or master it.

### The Zone of Competence

* Things you do well, but others can do just as well.
* Some people get stuck doing stuff in this zone because it feels easier to do it yourself than try to delegate it.

### The Zone of Excellence

* Activities you do extremely well. You can make a good living there.
* "For successful people, this zone is a seductive and even dangerous trap. To remain in this zone is to hobble yourself from taking the leap into your zone of genius."
* Your own addiction to comfort wants to keep you here, as do your family, friends, and organization--you're reliable there.
* "The problem is that a deep, sacred part of you will wither and die if you stay insize your Zone of Excellence."

### The Zone of Genius

* The set of activities you are uniquely suited to do, those that draw on your special gifts and strengths.
* By 40 most people have tuned out their internal calls towards this zone, and are getting internal alarms in the form of depression, illness, injury, and relationship conflict.
* You have to move into it 'gently and gracefully,' or you get painful dislocations in other life areas.

# Chapter 2: Making the Leap: Dismantling the Foundation of the Problem

* The Upper Limit Problem causes increases in success to bring on dramas in your life that prevent you from enjoying the increased success.
* If you see what's happening in time you can get control back.
* It's typical for self sabotage to happen after some period of settling in occurs, often about six months worth (particularly in personal relationships).

## Triggering the Upper Limit Problem

* The false foundation under the UL problem is four hidden barriers based on fear and false belief. Every person the author has worked with has had at least one, some two or three, nobody all four at once.
* The seem true/real and are based on beliefs about ourselves that are neither true nor real.
* That we unconsciously accept them as true/real is the thing holding us back.
* Start by considering the possibility that you have at least one hidden barrier holding you back. When you encounter the barrier(s), your UL problem is triggered.
* The form it takes is dependent on which fears and beliefs you picked up early in life.
* The fears and false beliefs cause us to live via a limiting mantra that says

    > I cannot expand to my full potential because ........

* In relationships, that says

    > I cannot enjoy abundant love and relationship harmony because ......

* In financial wealth, it says

    > I cannot expand to my full wealth potential because .........

* "When you remove the false beliefs, you feel a new freedom to invent a life based on your natural genius."

### Hidden Barrier no. 1: Feeling Fundamentally Flawed

* "A feeling that I'm fundamentally flawed in some way."
* "If you have a deep, old feeling that there's something wrong, bad, or flawed about you, you will find yourself grappling with that issue every time you break through to greater love and financial abundance."
* The thought "I should not be this [happy|rich|creative], because I am flawed" creates cognitive dissonance with experienced success or joy.
* The dissonance must be resolved in one of two ways
    * By returning to a previous 'safe' state that removes the success/joy
    * By letting go of the belief and being able to stabilize with the success/joy
* Best way to direct awareness to the thought of being fundamentally flawed is to consider it an Upper Limit 'bug', causing a breakdown in the system.
* Uses an example wherein somebody was a young child during divorce, and his father told him later that he couldn't look at him without experiencing some hatred for the mother. Kids internalize even very subtle emotional cues, and the guy internalized that he must be bad in some way for his father to look at him that way--even though none of the conflict between the parents was his fault or under his control.
* Good para:

    > The fear of being fundamentally flawed brings with it a related fear. It's the fear that if you did make a full commitment to living in your Zone of Genius, you might fail. It's the belief that even your genius is flawed, and that if you expressed it in a big way, it wouldn't be good enough. This belief tells you to play it safe and stay small. That way, if you fail, at least you fail small.

### Hidden Barrier no. 2: Disloyalty and Abandonment

* Unconscious mantra:

    > I cannot expand to my full success because it would cause me to end up all alone, be disloyal to my roots, and leave behind people from my past.

* Questions that can help you discover if you have this barrier:
    * Did I break the family's spoken or unspoken rules to get where I am?
    * Even though I am successful, did I fail to meet the expectations my parents had of me?
* If yes, you're likely to feel that seeking success on your own terms comes at the cost of leaving behind your roots or being disloyal to those who loved you. You feel guilt following success, and respond with self-punishment or sabotage.

### Hidden Barrier No. 3: Believing that More Success Brings a Bigger Burden

* UL Mantra for this one:

    > I can't expand to my highest potential because I'd be an even bigger burden than I am now.

* Author's own example: his father died a few weeks after his conception, leaving his mother broke, with a six year old and an at that point unknown pregnancy. Mother had him, went into a depression about a year later. His grandparents were next door, and extremely happy to have him. He was both a burden and a celebration.
* Later in life this played out as having a big positive breakthrough, then immediately starting to feel like he was a burden on the world.
* "Sometimes the world would pick up on my feeling and present immediate proof that I was indeed a burden."
* By his thirties he began to realize that most of the guilt he felt was for things he hadn't actually done:

    > I've found that if we remove the guilt of the crimes our parents and siblings convicted us of before we walked into kindergarten, we are liberated from the main issues that trigger the Upper Limit Problem.

### Hidden Barrier no. 4: The Crime of Outshining

* UL mantra:
    
    > I must not expand to my full success, because if I did I would outshine _________ and make him or her look or feel bad.

* Common among gifted/talented children
* Get lots of parental attention, but also a strong subliminal message of "don't shine too much, or you'll make others feel bad or look bad."
* One unconscious solution kids adopt is to tone down the volume on the expression of their abilities.
* Other solution is to continue to use their talents, but obscure their enjoyment of them: "If they can appear to be suffering, they can get empathy and sympathy from others instead of jealousy."
* Interesting:

    > One great thing about Upper Limit work is that it doesn't take much time to spot where the problem is coming from. Once you see it, you've turned on a light in a long-dark room. There's cleanup work that usually needs to be done, but with the light on, it's not that hard.

* Story: guy was a piano prodigy from a young age. His sister, also a gifted musician, was someone he was close to. She died of leukemia at age 8, and he put himself into his music even more. Eventually his parents bought him a grand piano and surprised him with it on his birthday. When he was about to touch the keys for the first time, his mother said, "We never would have been able to afford this if your sister hadn't died." He felt crippling guilt associated with musical success for the next 40 years. Eventually he realized that the crime he'd been convicted of, being alive and therefore outshining his sister for all time, was a crime only in his parents' imagination.

## Going Forward

* You understand the root structure of the UL problem, but you have to go into the particulars of your life experience.
* Your personal UL problem lives in the moment to moment interactions you have with yourself and the people around you.
* Only way to interrogate it is to focus on specific aspects of your daily life.

# Chapter 3: Getting Specific: How to Spot the Upper Limit Problem in Daily Lifez

* Chapter is about focusing awareness on specific actions, in service of identifying how your particular Upper Limit Problem operates.
* "In learning to live in your Zone of Genius, you'll benefit from making a lifelong pursuit out of spotting your Upper Limit behaviors. Make spotting them part of your daily ongoing maintenance activities[.]"

## Typical Ways We Upper-Limit Ourselves

* "When you're 'Upper-Limiting,' you're doing something that is crimping your flow of positive energy."
* What follows are behaviors that are common ways we do that.

### Worry

* Usually a sign of Upper-Limiting, and not a sign of useful thinking.
* Crucial sign of this is worrying about things you have no control over.
* Worrying is useful if and only if it concerns a topic we can do something about, and if it leads to our taking positive action right away.
* Other worry is unconsciously aimed at keeping us in Excellence or Competence
* Process:
    1. Things are going well.
    1. UL mechanism kicks in.
    1. We start worrying about things going wrong somehow.
    1. We justify those worries with other worries, and begin catastrophizing.
* If you notice your worry thoughts, many or most of them are very disconnected from reality.
* Questions to ask to know if it is something you should pay attention to:
    * Is it a real possibility?
    * Is there any action I can take right now to make a positive difference?
* Interesting:
    
    > When things are going well, or when you're feeling particularly good, you can always bring yourself down by manufacturing a stream of worry-thoughts. Once you've brought yourself down by worrying, it's very tempting to inflict those worry thoughts on ohters. If we're in the grip of worrying while someone around us isn't, we seem to have an almost uncontrollable urge to criticize that person until he or she jumps into the stream of negativity with us.

* Worry is an addiction, like gambling. Every once in a while you're rewarded with something happening that you worried about, which validates the behavior.

### Worry: What You Can Do Right Now

* You can use occurrences of worry as springboards into your Zone of Genius
* Sequence of steps the author takes:
    1. Notices himself worrying about something.
    1. Lets go of the worry thoughts, shifting focus away from them.
    1. Wonders: what positive new thing is trying to come into being?
    1. Usually gets a body feeling (not a thought/idea) of where that positive new thing is trying to come through.
    1. Opens his focus to feel that body feeling deeply.
    1. Lets himself feel it deeply for as long as he possibly can.
    1. Later, often gets an idea of the positive thing that was trying to come.
* He goes through a concrete example that makes me want to kick him, because it basically amounts to "I was worried about money until I remembered I'm rich."

### Criticism and Blame

* Criticism also generally has little to do with the thing we're criticizing, just as worry is often disconnected from reality.
* "When we blame someone or something, we're doing it because we've hit our Upper Limit and are trying to retard the flow of positive energy."
* "Criticizing and blaming are like being in a hypnotic trance. When we're in the trance, we really believe that the other person has done wrong."
* Criticism and blame are also addictions, and the number-one destroyer of intimacy in close relationships.
* To find out if your UL behavior is an addiction, try stopping it for a day.
* "Self-criticism and criticizing others are one and the same."
* Criticism is also only useful if it is directed at a specific thing and produces a useful result.
* Need to eliminate *chronic* criticism and *chronic* blame. They are never about producing a result.
* Become a keen observer of critical statements that you say or think, and sort them into two piles: real/actionable, and everything else.

### Deflecting

* Lots of people crimp the flow of positive energy by avoiding it entirely via deflecting.
* Example:
    * "You did a great job on that presentation!"
    * "Nah, I ran out of time and didn't get to everything."
* It keeps positive energy from landing, being received, being acknowledged.
* Deflecting positive energy keeps us in Competence or Excellence.
* It keeps us from challenging ourselves, from expanding our capacity for experiencing positive energy.
* When you notice yourself deflecting:
    * Pause for a moment to register the positive energy being aimed at you.
    * Then thank the person who is sending it.
* Getting beyond this UL problem has a lot to do with creating space within ourselves to feel and appreciate natural good feelings.

### Squabbling

* Starting a conflict can bring you down very quickly when you've hit UL
* This sounds...weird:

    > For example, once Kathlyn and I figured out that our arguments were Upper Limit symptoms, we were able to reduce drastically the number of conflicts we had. As of this writing, we haven't had an argument in more than twelve years.

* They've done a bunch of creative stuff together though, so that's interesting.
* Why arguments occur:

    > Arguments are caused by two people (or two countries) racing to occupy the victim position in the relationship. Person A claims the victim position and then tries to get person B to agree with that assessment. In other words, person B has to agree that he or she is the persecutor. Therein lies the problem. It's almost impossible to get the other guy to agree that it's his fault.

* "Once the race for the victim position is under way, each person must find some way to out-victim the other. In other words, each person must present an escalating series of 'proofs' that he or she is the real victim."
* Interesting:

    > Understanding the physics of arguments will reveal how conflicts [...] can be resolved. [...] The key insight: each entity in a situation represents 100 percent. Each entity in a conflict has 100 percent of the responsiblity for resolving the conflict. In other words, person A is a whole and complete 100 percent, and person B is a whole and complete 100 percent. If two people are involved, there is 200 percent responsibility to be divided up. The fatal mistake is thinking that there is 100 percent of responsibility to be divided up; this approach requires each person to take some portion of the 100 percent. It's a massive thinking error that causes massive problems, because it leads to endless jockeying for the victim position.
    >
    > If you don't realize that each person is a 100 percent entity, you're left with the impossible task of apportioning 100 percent among the participants in the conflict. [...] Once you start trying to apportion 100 percent among two or more people, you enter a surreal tunnel from which there is only one escape. The only way out is to assign each party 100 percent, and to invite each party to take it.
    >
    > If both people will claim 100 percent responsibility, there's a possibility of ending the conflict. Nothing less than 100 percent will work. Since there's 200 percent responsibility to be shared, jockeying for the victim position means that you're demanding that the other person take more than 100 percent while you take less than 100 percent. Nobody in his right mind would agree to a deal like that[.]

* That's an idea with merit, that the best way to solve the conflict is to have all parties completely committed to solving it. It doesn't model actual zero sum situations very well though.

### Getting Sick, Getting Hurt

* Some of us have a pattern when things are going well of getting sick/hurt.
* "If you can pull up memories of some of your illnesses and accidents, ask yourself if they came during or just after a big win in business or a period of good times in a relationship."
* That reads like anecdata to me. I don't trust that it's based on anything other than intuition.
* He admits that people do get sick/hurt for all sorts of reasons.
* "However, if you are keely interested in taking your Big Leap, you will want to examine everything that brings you pain and suffering as a potential Upper Limit symptom."
* Yeah, this sounds like pure new age bullshit to me.

## The Three P's

* Map the author uses for understanding "the driving force behind many illnesses and accidents" is the three Ps:
    * Punishment - You are punishing yourself for something by being sick/hurt.

        > Many physical symptoms such as headache and back pain are warning signs, like the flapping and wobble of a flat tire when you're driving on the highway. The symptoms are saying, _slow down, stop what you're doing, and pay attention, because there's something out of integrity here._

    * Prevention and Protection:

        > When you suffer symptoms of illness or experience an accident, you often do so because you're unconsciously trying to prevent yourself from having to do something you don't really want to do and/or protect yourself from something you don't want to feel. The illness or accident is your unconscious mind's clunky way of doing you a favor.

* Pain and suffering is sometimes just that, but can also be symptomatic of an underlying need to experience change or growth. That's me saying that, I think the way he said it is dumb.

## Integrity Breach

* "Committing a breach of integrity is one of the quickest ways to bring yourself down after an excursion past your Upper Limit."
* Most popular:
    * lies
    * broken agreements
    * withheld truths
* Most people think of integrity as a moral issue, and it is.
* However, you can frame it as a physics issue instead
* One historical meaning of integrity was "wholeness" and "completeness"
* Being out of integrity was a breach in your completeness.
* Interesting part of the frame:

    > Morality is about good and bad, right and wrong--all of which are highly arguable. Physics is about did and didn't, not is and isn't.

* Physics approach:
    * Communication between people is a flow of energy
    * Internal communication is also a flow of energy
    * A breach of integrity stops the flow
* Holy crap, this is revealing:

    > By the way, I recommend that you break the surface like this only with people you care about. I don't think it's worth your while to go to this deeper level with the pizza delivery guy or the meter maid.

* His example:
    * Two people meet on the street, A asks "How are you?"
    * B replies, "Fine."
    * B does not look fine--anything but. A notices this.
    * A is faced with a choice:
        * Be 'polite' and overlook it
        * Mention it, go to a deeper level of communication: "Are you really fine? You look worried."
    * If A chooses the go deeper, the flow of communication continues, else blocked.
    * (The flow of communication includes A's awareness of B's deflection.)
* Where are most people likely to experience integrity breaches?
    * Subtle lies we tell ourselves to conceal feelings we do not want to accept consciously.
* An UL problem "puts people into an altered state of consciousness. We 'go unconscious' in the sense of losing touch with our rational faculties. We don't see the bigger picture."
* Question that he uses to get people to break out:

    > Would you be willing to consider that your conflict is not about what you think it's about?

* Brings up psychological projection, says:

    > Simply put, if you have some emotion within you that you don't know how to manage, you seal that emotion away and start trying to manage other people's versions of it.

* Interesting:

    > Under the surface of most conflicts, you'll find that the warring parties are actually feeling the same deeper emotions. Two people may be locked in an angry conflict for weeks. When they get beneath the roiled surface of the issue, however, they discover that the real issue is that they're both sad about something they've both kept hidden. They've been so locked into proving each other wrong that they haven't taken a moment to contact the true heart of the issue.

### The First Step to Wholeness: Discovering Your Story

* To find integrity breaches and restore wholeness, we need to get good at questions like:
    * Where do I feel out of integrity with myself?
    * What is keeping me from feeling complete and whole?
    * What important feelings am I not letting into my awareness?
    * Where in my life am I not telling the full truth?
    * Where in my life have I not kept my promises?
    * In my relationship with X, what do I need to say or do to feel complete and whole?
* These are the kinds of questions that will "lift you out of the limiting story you've been living in."
* There are multiple possible narratives about why accessing your own genius leads to problems, and your own is probably unique to your family history.
* Interesting:

    > Whatever your story is, the first task is to find it. Identify your family story of why you shouldn't access your genius. Once you've identified it, the next task is to lose your fascination with it.

### The Attitude

* The task of identifying your story can feel overwhelming, but the practical moments of actually doing it are quite short--a few seconds to identify a feeling, communicate a specific idea to another person, etc.
* Attempt an attitude of wonder instead of blame. You make progress faster by noticing and accepting rather than using things you find as avenues of self criticism.

## Action Steps

* Specific actions which will keep you on track to be in the zone of genius:
    * Repeat to yourself as often as you like, "I commit to discovering my Upper Limit behaviors, and to having a good time while I'm learning about them."
    * Make a list of your identified Upper Limit behaviors. Some common ones:
        * Worrying
        * Blame and criticism
        * Getting sick or hurt
        * Squabbling
        * Hiding significant feelings
        * Not keeping agreements
        * Not speaking significant truths to the relevant people
        * Deflecting
    * When you notice yourself doing one of your UL behaviors, shirt your attention to the real issue: expanding your capacity for abundance, love, and success.
    * Consciously let yourself make more room in your awareness for abundance, love, and success. Use the resources of your whole being, not just your mind. For example, feel more love in your chest and heart area. Savor the body feeling, as well as the mental satisfaction, of success and abundance.
    * Embrace a new story that tells about your adventures in your Zone of Genius. Find a new mythology, or make up one of your own, that shows you enjoying your life in the full radiance of your expressed potential.

# Chapter 4: Building a New Home in Your Zone of Genius: How to Make Every Moment an Expression of Your Genius

* Chapter attempts to help you answer two questions:
    * What is my genius?
    * How can I bring forth my genius in ways that serve others and myself at the same time?
* "Discovering your Zone of Genius is your life's Big Leap."
* Interesting:

    > We all need to be on the lookout for signs of our Upper Limit Problem every day of our lives. It's a constant quest, because we're always raising the bar on ourselves. The better we get, the better we want to be. Part of us wants very much to live in our Zone of Genius. Yet at the same time, we're tied down by forces around us. The people around us want us to stay in our Zone of Excellence. We're a lot more reliable there.

* People tend to have very well crafted internal narratives about why they can't take a Big Leap:
    * "I can't take the time to [...] because my family needs me."
    * "I can't do what I want because I might not make as much money."
* Interesting:

    > There is a huge fear underneath every complaint: If I took the Big Leap into my Zone of Genius, I might fail. What if I really opened up to my true genius and found that my genius wasn't good enough.

## Your Genius Commitment

* Again with the bullshit about making a commitment to his system.
* "In coaching people to discover their genius, I've found that it's essential to begin with a commitment to living in your Zone of Genius. Your commitment must come before you know how to make good on it."
* Ugh.

## The Genius Questions

* Questions here are intended to help you "bring forth hidden treasures from deep inside you. Wonder is the tool that invites these treasures up into the light."

### 1. What do I most love to do?

* Something you can do for long stretches of time without getting tired or bored.

### 2. What work do I do that doesn't seem like work?

* Something you can do without getting tired or bored.
* Supposedly this question renders "what I most love" into something more specific, but it totally leaves aside anyone whose love or genius doesn't translate into revenue producing action.
* "When you're doing it, you think, 'This is why I do the work I do.'" So what if you're a ditch digger who doesn't love digging ditches?

### 3. In my work, what produces the highest ratio of abundance and satisfaction to amount of time spent?

* Even if I do only ten seconds or a few minutes of it, an idea or a deeper connection may spring forth that leads to huge value.
* This paragraph makes me want to kick this guy:

    > By asking myself this question, I discovered that part of my genius is the free play of ideas in my mind. It's the ability to let ideas tumble and transform, free of criticism and censure, until something useful emerges. I've had projects where I've incubated and tumbled an idea for years before the fruitful outcome came forth, but I've also had experiences in which a few seconds devoted to free mind play have turned into millions in revenue. I never know exactly where it's going to lead or whether it's going to lead anywhere at all.

* I dunno, money just falls from the sky when I play with ideas! What an ass.
