# Chapter 1: The Case for Teamwork

* "Teamwork remains the one sustainable competitive advantage that has been largely untapped."
* It's not talked about enough because it's not really possible to isolate as a single variable, and many executives prefer solutions that are more easily measurable and verifiable.
* It's also hard to achieve.
* It's very fulfilling--gives a sense of connection and belonging, which has knock on effects in other areas of people's lives.

    * Avoidance of Accountability
    * Lack of Commitment
    * Fear of Conflict
    * Absence of Trust

## A Quick Overview of the Model

* Measure of a team is accomplishing what it sets out to do.
* To do that consistently, it must overcome the following five dysfunctions:
    1. *Absence of Trust* - "Members of great teams trust one another on a fundamental, emotional level, and they are comfortable being vulnerable with each other about their weaknesses, mistakes, fears, and behaviors. They get to a point where they can be completely open with one another, without filters. This is essential because..."
    1. *Fear of Conflict* - "... teams that trust one another are not afraid to engage in passionate dialogue around issues and decisions that are key to the organization's success. They do not hesitate to disagree with, challenge, and question one another, all in the spirit of finding the best answers, discovering the truth, and making great decisions. This is important because..."
    1. *Lack of Commitment* - "... teams that engage in unfiltered conflict are able to achieve genuine buy-in around important decisions, even when various members of the team initially disagree. That's because they ensure that all opinions and ideas are put on the table and considered, giving confidence to team members that no stone has been left unturned. This is critical because..."
    1. *Avoidance of Accountability* - "...teams that commit to decisions and standards of performance do not hesitate to hold one another accountable for adhering to those decisions and standards. What is more, they don't rely on the team leader as the primary source of accountability, they go directly to their peers. This matters because..."
    1. *Inattention to Results* - "...teams that trust one another, engage in conflict, commit to decisions, and hold one another accountable are very likely to set aside their individual needs and agendas and focus almost exclusively on what is best for the team. They do not give in to the temptation to place their departments, career aspirations, or ego-driven status ahead of the collective results that define team success."

# Chapter 2: Two Important Questions

## Question 1: Are we really a team?

* A team is a relatively small number of people (3-12) that shares common goals, and the rewards and responsibilities for achieving them.
* Team members readily set aside their individual/personal needs for the greater good of the group.
* Possible that your 'team' is a subset of the group, or you may just be a set of people in the same org but with little interdependence and mutual accountability.

## Question 2: Are we ready for heavy lifting?

* Advantages of being a team are real, but can't be achieved without a willingness to invest a lot of time and emotional energy.
* It doesn't have to take years, and it doesn't have to be unpleasant.

# Chapter 3: Overcoming Dysfunction 1 (Absence of Trust)

## Building Trust

* Author's work with teams revolves around trust more than anything else.
* Trust is quite rare, but if you can build it you can achieve a lot.
* Why is it rare?
    * The word is used inconsistently, and thus means different things to different people.
    * Because it's hard.

### Defining Trust

* It is _not_ about knowing someone well enough to predict their actions. Knowing someone will harm you if you take action X is not trusting them.
* Trust on teams is about vulnerability, around failures, weaknesses, fears.
* Interesting:

    > Vulnerability-based trust is predicated on th simple--and practical--idea that people who aren't afraid to admit the truth about themselves are not going to engage in the kind of political behavior that wastes everyone's time and energy, and more important, makes the accomplishment of results an unlikely scenario.

### The Difficulty of Vulnerability-Based Trust

* Human beings have a drive for self-preservation that's exacerbated by culture.
* Team members have to become comfortable being exposed to one another, and unafraid to say things like:
    * "I was wrong."
    * "I made a mistake."
    * "I need help."
    * "I'm not sure."
    * "You're better than I am at that."
    * "I'm sorry."
* If they can't say those things, they waste time thinking about what they _should_ say, and questioning their peers intentions.
* "The key ingredient to building trust is not time. It is courage."
* "For a team to establish real trust, team members, beginning with the leader, must be willing to take risks without a guarantee of success. They will have to be vulnerable without knowing whether that vulnerability will be respected and reciprocated."

## Tools and Exercises

### The Personal Histories Exercise

* Helps people get comfortable with moderate vulnerability.
* At a staff meeting or offsite, go around and have everybody say three things:
    * Where they grew up
    * How many kids in their family
    * The most difficult or important challenge of their childhood
* "Asking people to be too vulnerable too quickly is not only unfair, it often provokes a resistance that is hard to overcome later."
* A side benefit is that it helps people overcome the fundamental attribution error, which is one of the big destroyers of teamwork.
* Fundamental Attribution Error: people tend to falsely attribute the negative behavior of others to their character (an internal attribution), but attribute their own negative behaviors to their environment (an external attribution).
* Similarly we often attribute other people's success to their environment, and our own success to our character. We are good, others are merely lucky.
* Learning how other team members became who they are today helps them become empathetic with each other when interpreting behavior.
* "One of the keys to making [the exercise] work is to anticipate the initial objections of team participants."
    * "I'm not interested in your inner child"
    * "It's the only exercise we'll do that's even remotely touchy-feely"
* Another key is proper facilitation.
    * Sometimes people genuinely can't think of any childhood difficulties, which is okay.
    * Sometimes people disclose something quite sensitive (abuse, death, addiction, etc.). Important to demonstrate focused listening and respectful appreciation. Sometimes you just let the moment be and pass, saying thank you.
