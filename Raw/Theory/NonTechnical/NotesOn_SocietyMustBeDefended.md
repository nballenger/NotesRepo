# Notes on "Society Must Be Defended," by Michel Foucault

## Foreword, by Francois Eqald and Allesandro Fontana

* Book comprises lectures Foucault gave at College de France, where he taught from '71 till his death in '84, as chair of 'History of Systems of Thought.'
* Anybody could come listen to his lectures, and he had large audiences.
* "[He] often complained about the distance this could put between him and his "audience" and about the way the lecture format left so little room for dialogue. **He dreamed of holding a seminar in which truly collective work could be done.**"
* "Michel Foucault approached his teaching as a researcher. He explored possibilities for books in preparation, outlined fields of problematization, as though he were handing out invitations to potential researchers."
* He used current events to bring his listeners into the arguments.
* This book is the most literal transcription possible of his lectures:
    * Some repetitions have been cut, some broken sentences finished.
    * Ellipses indicate the tape was inaudible.
    * Brackets around obscure phrases indicate a conjectural interpolation/addition.
    * Asterisks indicate significant variations between notes and spoken lecture.
    * Quotations have been checked, references supplied.
    * Each lecture is preceded by a brief summary.

## Introduction, by Arnold I. Davidson

* Foucault liked that courses were open to anyone who wanted to attend
* "According to [Gilles] Deleuze, the majority of Foucault's books establish _"a precise archive with exceedingly new historical means,"_ while in his interviews and conversations, Foucault explicitly confronts the other half of his task, tracing lines of actualization that _"pull us toward a future, toward a becoming."_ Analytical strata and diagnostic contemporaneity are two essential poles of Foucault's entire work." _p. xvi_
* "The focus of this 1976 course is on one alternative conceptualization of power, a mode of thought that analyzes power relations in terms of the model of war, that looks for the principle of intelligibility of politics in the general form of war." _p. xvii_
* "[...] Foucault's preoccupation with the schema of war was central to his formulation of the strategic model of power, of force-relations, a strategic model that would allow us to reorient our conception of power." _p. xviii_
* "Arrangements of relations of forces have a strategic intelligibility, and their rationality, as well as the transformation of these arrangements into other coherent arrangements, obeys a logic distinct from both the logic of epistemic coherence and transformations studied by Foucault in hsi archaeological works, and from the logic of the model of sovereignty and the law that is the direct object of Foucault's criticisms here." _p. xix_
* "[...] as early as 1967 Foucault recognized that the form of strategic intelligibility could also be applied to discursive practices." _p. xix_
* "[...] nonlinguistic level of the analysis of discourse is in fact the level of strategic intelligibility." _p. xx_
* Quoting Foucault directly: "One can speak of the perspectival character of knowledge because there is a battle and knowledge is the effect of this battle." _p. xxi_
* "Finally, I want to indicate that this course can be read within the framework of what Foucault called his 'circular' project, a project that involves two endeavors that refer back to each other. On the one hand, **Foucault wanted to rid us of a juridical representation of power, conceived of in terms of law, prohibition, and sovereignty**, a clearing away that raises the question of how we are to analyze what has taken place hin history without the use of this system of representation. On the other hand, Foucault wanted to carry out a more meticulous historical examination in order to show that **in modern societies power has not in fact functioned in the form of law and sovereignty, a historical analysis that forces one to find another form of representation that does not depend on the juridical system.**" _p. xxi_
