# Notes on Rework

By Jason Fried

# Introduction

* 16 person company
* Remote-focused

# Chapter 1: The New Reality

* Barriers to entrepreneurship are lower than ever.

# Chapter 2: Takedowns

## Ignore the real world

* Pessimism doesn't really help much, and you shouldn't spend too much time listening to pessimists.
* "The real world isn't a place, it's an excuse. It's a justification for not trying. It has nothing to do with you."

## Learning from Mistakes is Overrated

* You don't actually have to fail a lot to move forward or learn.
* Other people's failures don't mean you have to fail.
* Learn from your successes, not your mistakes.
* "Success is the experience that actually counts."

## Planning is Guessing

* "Unless you're a fortune-teller, long-term business planning is a fantasy. There are just too many factors that are out of your hands ... **Writing a plan makes you feel in control of things you can't actually control.**"
* Plans are guesses. Strategic plan = Strategic guess. Don't worry about them so much.
* "Plans let the past drive the future. The put blinders on you. ... Plans are inconsistent with improvisation."
* It's still worth thinking about the future, just don't feel you need to memorialize it or obsess over it.
* "Working without a plan may seem scary. But blindly following a plan that has no relationship with reality is even scarier."

## Why grow?

* We don't measure great cultural institutions on their size (great universities, museums, etc), so why measure businesses that way?
* The right size for your company is the right size. "Grow slow and see what feels right ... and avoid huge growth spurts too--they can cause you to skip right over your appropriate size."
* Once you get bigger, it's really hard to shrink without firing people, damaging morale, and changing your entire structure/model.

## Workaholism

* It's stupid. Working more doesn't mean you care more or get more done, it just means you work more.
* It creates more problems than it solves. Leads to burnout, mistakes, etc.
* "Workaholics miss the point, too. They try to fix problems by throwing sheer hours at them."
* **"They even create crises. They don't look for ways to be more efficient because they actually _like_ working overtime. They enjoy feeling like heroes. They create problems (often unwittingly) just so they can get off on working more."**
* **"Workaholics make the people who don't stay late feel inadequate for 'merely' working reasonable hours. That leads to guilt and poor morale all around. Plus, it leads to an ass-in-seat mentality--people stay late out of obligation, even if they aren't really being productive."**

## Enough with "entrepreneurs"

* Refocus not on self-proclaimed entrepreneurs, but on people who are succeeding because they do what they love on their own terms.
* Call them "starters."

# Chapter 3: Go

## Make a Dent in the Universe

* "To do great work you need to feel that you're making a difference. ... That you're part of something important."
* You should feel a sense of urgency about it.
* "If you're going to do something, do something that matters."

## Scratch Your Own Itch

* Easiest way to make a great product/service is to make something you yourself want to use.
* If you're solving someone else's problem, you're stabbing in the dark.

## Start Making Something

* "The most important thing is to begin."

## No time is no excuse

* "There's always enough time if you spend it right."
* Spend some of your free time on your project--that'll let you know whether it's got enough interest and excitement for you to be a real thing.
* The perfect time never arrives.

## Draw a Line in the Sand

* "As you get going, keep in mind _why_ you're doing what you're doing. Great businesses have a point of view, not just a product or service. You have to believe in something. You need to have a backbone."
* Having strong opinions is polarizing. Learn to deal with it.
* "We're willing to lose some customers if it means that others love our products intensely. That's our line in the sand."
* **"When you don't know what you believe, everything becomes an argument. Everything is debatable. But when you stand for something, decisions are obvious."

## Mission Statement Impossible

* Big difference between actually standing for something and having a mission statement that _says_ you stand for something.

## Outside Money is Plan Z

* A lot of companies don't need expensive up front infrastructure.
* "Spending other people's money may sound great, but there's a noose attached. Here's why: **You give up control.** When you turn to outsiders for funding, you have to answer to them too."
    * "Cashing out" begins to trump building a quality business.
    * "Spending other people's money is addictive."
    * "It's usually a bad deal."
    * It makes customers secondary to funders.
    * Raising money is incredibly distracting.
* Before you do it, look for another way.

## You Need Less Than You Think

* Do you really need:
    * X people?
    * Y money?
    * Z time to make something?
    * N infrastructure?
    * M service providers or professionals?

## Start a Business, Not a Startup

* Funded startups are fairy tales that let you ignore revenue in/out.
* "A business without a path to profit isn't a business; it's a hobby."
* **"Actual businesses don't mask deep problems by saying, 'It's ok, we're a startup.'"

## Building to Flip is Building to Flop

* "You need a commitment strategy, not an exit strategy."
* Focusing on being acquired makes you focus on the wrong stuff.

## Less Mass

* From this moment, you're going to accumulate mass. More mass = more energy required to change direction.
* Mass is increased by:
    * Long term contracts
    * Excess staff
    * Permanent decisions
    * Meetings
    * Thick process
    * Inventory (physical or mental)
    * Hardware, software, and technology lock-ins
    * Long term road maps
    * Office politics
* Avoid these things whenever you can, to leave yourself free to change direction.

# Chapter: Progress

## Embrace Constraints

* "Constraints are advantages in disguise. Limited resources force you to make do with with you've got."

## Build half a product, not a half-assed product

* "You can turn a bunch of great ideas into a crappy product real fast by trying to do them all at once."
* "Cut your ambition in half."
* If the ideas are truly great, you can do them later.

## Start at the Epicenter

* If you're opening a hot dog stand, making great hot dogs is the epicenter--everything else is secondary.
* To find it, ask yourself this question: **"If I took this away, would what I'm selling still exist?"**
* What part of your equation cannot be removed?

## Ignore the Detals Early On

* "Getting infatuated with details too early leads to disagreement, meetings, and delays. You get lost in things that don't really matter."
* Echoes the "thick markers for unformed ideas, thin for details"

## Making the Call is Making Progress

* When you put off decisions, they pile up. Those end up ignored, dealt with in haste, or thrown out, so the individual problems stay unresolved.
* **"Whenever you can, swap 'Let's think about it' for 'Let's decide on it.' Commit to making decisions. Don't wait for the perfect solution. Decide and move forward."**
* Get into the rhythym of making choices. It builds momentum and boosts morale.
* "Long projects zap morale. The longer it takes to develop, the less likely it is to launch. Make the call, make progress, and get something out now--while you've got the motivation and momentum to do so."

## Be a Curator

* "A curator is involved, making conscious decisions about what should stay and what should go. There's an editing process. There's a lot more stuff _off_ the walls than _on_ the walls. **The best is a sub-sub-subset of all the possibilities.**"
* Constantly look for stuff to remove, simplify, streamline.

## Throw Less at the Problem

* Cut back, then polish what remains.
* "When things aren't working, the natural inclination is to throw more at the problem. More people, time, and money. All that ends up doing is making the problem bigger."
* "If you start pushing back deadlines and increasing your budget, you'll never stop."

## Focus on What Won't Change

* Lots of people and companies get hooked by the next big thing. That's a fool's path, focused on fashion instead of substance.
* "The core of your business should be built around things that won't change. Things that people are going to want today and ten years from now."

## Tone is in Your Fingers

* Fancy stuff can help, but your tone is yours on whatever equipment you use.
* "Use whatever you've got already or can afford cheaply. Then go."

## Sell Your By-Products

* "When you make something, you always make something else. ... Everything has a by-product. Observant and creative business minds spot these by-products and see opportunities."
* If you're not manufacturing something, it can be hard to see your by-products. Thinking you don't have any though is myopic.

## Launch Now

* Just because there are outstanding issues doesn't mean you can't release.
* Thought experiment: if you had to launch in two weeks, what would you keep, and what would you cut? Imposing a deadline brings a lot of clarity.

# Chapter: Productivity

## Illusions of Agreement

* There are reams and reams of unread documents out there that do nothing but waste people's time. They take forever to make, seconds to forget.
* If you need to explain something, get real with it. Draw instead of describe.
* **Do everything you can to remove layers of abstraction.**
* **"The problem with abstractions (like reports and documents) is that they create illusions of agreement. A hundred people can read the same words, but in their heads, they're imagining a hundred different things."**
* Get to something real right away

## Reasons to Quit

* Easy to work on what you _think_ needs doing, harder to stop and ask why.
* Important questions to ensure you're doing work that matters:
    * Why are you doing this?
        * What is this for?
        * Who benefits?
        * What's the motivation behind it?
    * What problem are you solving?
        * Are customers confused?
        * Are you confused?
        * Is something unclear?
        * Was something not possible before that should be now?
    * Is this actually useful?
        * Are you making something useful, or just making something?
    * Are you adding value?
        * Adding something is easy, adding value is hard.
        * Does it make the product better for customers?
        * Can they get more out of it now than before?
    * Will this change behavior?
        * Is what you're working on going to change anything?
    * Is there an easier way?
    * What could you be doing instead?
        * What can't you do because you're doing this?
        * Particularly important for small teams with limited resources.
    * Is it really worth it?
        * Is it worth pulling these people into a meeting?
        * Is it worth getting stressed over?
        * Is it worth spending money on?
* Sometimes you find you're solving an imaginary problem.
* **Don't be timid about your conclusions. ... Don't throw good time after bad work.**

## Interruption is the enemy of productivity

* "Interruption is not collaboration, it's just interruption. And when you're interrupted, you're not getting work done."
* You should get long stretches of alone time to be productive.
* Getting into a productive zone takes time and requires avoiding interruptions.
* Set aside blocks of time and guard them.
* During alone time, don't be on communications platforms.

## Meetings are Toxic

* The worst interruptions are meetings:
    * They're usually about words and abstract concepts, not real things
    * They usually convey an abysmally small amount of info/minute
    * They drift off-subject incredibly fast
    * They require thorough prep that most people don't have time for
    * They frequently have agendas so vague that nobody is sure of the goal
    * They often include at least one moron who gets to waste everybody's time with nonsense
    * They multiply--one leads to another to another.
* They're also scheduled badly--you block a half hour or hour because that's what calendar apps do, then if you use a fraction you end up stretching to the whole time period.
* They're _incredibly_ expensive in terms of lost productivity.
* If you have to have one, try these things:
    * Set a timer. When it rings, the meeting is over, period.
    * Invite as few people as possible.
    * Always have a clear agenda.
    * Begin with a specific problem.
    * Meet at the site of the problem rather than in a conference room. Point to real things and suggest real changes.
    * End with a solution, and make someone responsible for implementing it.

## Good Enough is Fine

* Lots of people like finding complex solutions because it lets them think hard.
* Instead find a 'judo solution', one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort.
* Problems are negotiable. They can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions.
* "When good enough gets the job done, go for it. It's way better than wasting resources or, even worse, doing nothing because you can't afford the complex solution."

## Quick Wins

* Momentum fuels motivation.
* To build momentum, get something done and move on to the next thing.
* The longer something takes, the less likely it is that you're going to finish it.
* "If you absolutely have to work on long-term projects, try to dedicate one day a week (or every two weeks) to small victories that generate enthusiasm."
* You want a steady stream of good news.
* Ask, "What can we do in two weeks?" Then do it and get it in front of people.
* **"The quicker it's in the hands of customers, the better off you'll be."**

## Don't be a Hero

* "A lot of times it's better to be a quitter than a hero."
* People overwork out of sunk-costs all the time.
* It leads to cutting yourself off from feedback, which can lead you even further down the wrong path.
* They decided that if anything takes one of them longer than two weeks, they have to bring other people in to take a look. Those people might not do any work, but they can review it and give their opinion.
* Sometimes the obvious (and right) solution is quitting. People associate quitting with failure, but sometimes quitting is exactly what you should do.
* You can't get your sunk costs back, and the worst thing to do is to throw good time after bad work.

## Go to Sleep

* Forgoing sleep has real and extreme costs / detriments:
    * Stubbornness - when you're tired, you keep plowing down whatever bad path you're on instead of reconsidering.
    * Lack of creativity - One of the first things to go
    * Diminished morale - You lose motivation for big tasks
    * Irritability - patience and tolerance go way down

## Your Estimates Suck

* Everyone is a terrible estimator.
* You absolutely cannot know that something will happen weeks, months, or years into the future.
* With simple tasks (going to the store, for example), our estimates are frequently off by a factor of two or more. How can we expect to accurately predict anything six months off?
* That means if you guess six months, you might be way, way off--a year, not just seven months instead of six.
* Solution: break the big thing into smaller things. You'll still be wrong, but the costs of being wrong will be way less.
* Keep breaking things down. Twelve one week projects instead of one twelve week project. Use six to ten hour chunks when you can.

## Long Lists Don't Get Done

* Make small to-do lists.
* **"Long lists are guilt trips. The longer the list of unfinished items, the worse you feel about it. And at a certain point, you just stop looking at it because it makes you feel bad. Then you stress out and the whole thing turns into a big mess."**
* Break the long list into small lists, so each item completed is a bigger portion of the entire list it belongs to. That increases motivation, satisfaction, and progress.
* Don't prioritize with numbers or labels. You just end up with a ton of high-priority stuff, which isn't actually prioritizing.
* Prioritize visually--important stuff at the top. Move down the list.

## Make Tiny Decisions

* **"Big decisions are hard to make and hard to change. And once you make one, the tendency is to continue believing you made the right decision, even if you didn't. You stop being objective."**
* Make choices that are small enough that they're effectively temporary. When you make tiny decisions you can't make big mistakes.
* Doesn't mean you can't make big plans or have big ideas--just means you realize those one tiny decision at a time.

# Chapter: Competitors

## Don't Copy

* Sometimes copying is part of learning, and a helpful tool to discovering your own voice.
* In business copying is usually just stealing.
* Copying is a formula for failure. You skip understanding, and understanding is how you grow.
* A huge amount of what an original creator puts into a work is invisible, buried beneath the surface.
* Also you can never keep up--you're always passive in relation to your competitor.
* Be influenced, but don't steal.

## Decommoditize Your Product

* If you're successful, people will try to copy what you do.
* To protect against that, make yourself part of your product or service. Inject what's unique about the way you think into what you sell.
* Decommoditize it--make it something no one else can offer.
* "Pour yourself into your product and everything _around_ your product too: how you sell it, how you support it, how you explain it, and how you deliver it. Competitors can never copy the _you_ in your product."

## Pick a Fight

* "If you think a competitor sucks, say so." People who agree will rally to you.
* You can pit yourself against an entire industry.
* "Having an enemy gives you a great story to tell customers."

## Underdo Your Competition

* Conventional wisdom is to constantly one-up your competitors. It just leads to a dead end arms race, puts you on the defensive, etc.
* Do less than your competitors to beat them. Solve the simple problems, leave the difficult, unpleasant ones to others.
* Do a few simple things and do them well.
* Don't shy away from doing less--highlight it. Be proud of it.

## Who Cares What They're Doing?

* Don't pay much attention to the competiton. It's paralyzing and dilutes your own vision.
* If you're going to be like everyone else, why are you doing this?

# Chapter: Evolution

## Say No By Default

* It's easy to say yes, and soon you're doing way too much.
* Get in the habit of saying no, even to many of your best ideas.
* Use it to get your priorities straight.
* People avoid saying no because they don't like confrontation. The alternative is worse--you drag things out, make them complicated, and work on ideas you don't believe in.
* Deal with the brief discomfort of confrotnation to avoid long term regret.
* The customer is not always right.
* Don't be a jerk about it, just be honest. Be polite and explain why you won't do something.
* **"Your goal is to make sure your product stays right for you. You're the one who has to believe in it most."**

## Let Your Customers Outgrow You

* Scenario: high dollar customer, company bends over backwards to please them, starts to alienate its general customer base. Then the big customer leaves and the company is left with a product that's ideally suited to someone who's not their customer anymore, and a bad fit for everyone else.
* Be willing to let your customers go, rather than compromising your product.
* You can't be everything to everyone.

## Don't Confuse Enthusiasm with Priority

* Coming up with a great idea is a rush, and makes you want to drop other stuff to pursue it.
* Your enthusiasm about a new idea is not an indicator of its inherent worth. Let it cool off for a while before you commit resources to it.

## Be At-Home Good

* Scenario: you're at a store, comparing items, get sold on the best deal. Most features, looks coolest, etc. When you get it home it doesn't deliver--not as easy to use as you want, too many features you don't need. You didn't get what you wanted and spent too much.
* That's an 'in-store-good' product. One you're excited to buy, but not excited to actually use.
* Smart companies make at-home good products. You get it home and you're _more_ impressed than when you were in the store. You live with it and like it more over time, and tell other people about it.

## Don't Write It Down

* Don't keep track of what customers want. Listen, but then forget what they said.
* The requests that matter are the ones you hear over and over. After a while you won't be able to forget them. Your customers will be your memory.
* If there's a request you keep forgetting, it's probably not really important.

# Chapter: Promotion

## Welcome Obscurity

* It's fine to be obscure for now. Make mistakes without doing so in front of the world.
* Once you get bigger and more popular, you'll inevitably take fewer risks.

## Build an Audience

* All companies have customers. Lucky companies have fans. The most fortunate have audiences.
* You want people to come to you--those are the most receptive customers and potential customers in existence.
* "Speak, write, blog, tweet, make videos--whatever. Share information that's valuable and you'll slowly but surely build a loyal audience. Then when you need to get the word out, the right people will already be listening."

## Out-Teach Your Competition

* Don't outspend, outsell, outsponsor competitors--out-teach them. 
* Teaching forms bonds that transcend marketing.
* Teaching is something individuals and smaller companies can do that bigger ones can't.

## Emulate Chefs

* Good and great chefs share what they know.
* You should share what you know too. There's actually very little knowledge that can be viewed as proprietary or competitive advantage.

## Go Behind the Scenes

* Show people how your business works. Even boring jobs are actually interesting to people, because we like to know how things are made.

## Nobody Likes Plastic Flowers

* Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real, and people respond to that.
* Talk like you really talk, reveal things other people might not. Be upfront about your shortcomings. Show the latest version of what you're working on, even if you're not done yet.

## Press Releases are Spam

* They're a terrible way to do what they're supposed to do.
* Call someone. Write a personal note. Contact journalists directly and pitch them with genuine passion and interest.

## Forget about the Wall Street Journal

* Shoot for trade publications, and places where your customers actually look. They're more hungry for stories.

## Drug Dealers Get It Right

* The
