Conceptual stuff:

Everything is an object except...
There are foundational behaviors of certain types: iterable, callable, etc.
References are not intrinsically typed
Iterables are not single-type
"When you make a request to an object, it is up to the object to decide whether and how to honor the request, and whether to raise an exception." - Python in a Nutshell, 3rd Ed., Chapter 3.
