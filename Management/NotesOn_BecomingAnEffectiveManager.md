# Notes on O'Reilly Learning Path: Becoming an Effective Manager

# Your Critical First Ten Days as a Leader

* You and your boss are both (presumably) invested in your success.
* It's unknown how much your people will invest in the team's collective success.
* Their initial investment decision is made in this early period.
* People assess where you fit in the constellation of leaders throughout the organization. Good relationships all over have a halo effect.

## The Truth about your New Role

* "Leader" is a title you only get from people willing to follow you.
* Your success is via the achievements of the team or unit you lead.
* New leaders often focus on the obvious facets of organizational power
    * Resources you can deploy
    * Formal authority
    * Access
* The attributes of positional power aren't unimportant--having the authority to do things, and being _seen_ to have that authority, is important.
* However, that authority is usually quite limited in practice.
* What's more important is your ability to influence others, because it determines what you can actually do and create via your authority.
* You can build important influence in your first ten days, and build it thereafter.
* Robert Cialdini's six principles for building influence across cultures:
    * Reciprocity: getting and doing favors
    * Commitment and consistency: If people commit to you early, they're wired to be consistent with that commitment.
    * Social proof: the first follower is the hardest to get.
    * Liking: People we like have more influence over us.
    * Authority: The greater your perceived authority (via position or expertise), the more influence you have.
    * Scarcity: Controlling something people want makes you have influence.
* These are key to building influence in your first ten days, because they're the foundation of meaningful connection.
* Thinking of leadership as behavior-based rather than positional makes it possible for you to build leadership capacity and capability.
* Your effectiveness also results from "your ability to integrate your strengths and weaknesses with the needs of your followers."
* You need to be attuned to what your team needs--you can't, for instance, disclose vulnerability to people looking for a strong leader.
* "Your leadership challenge is to create the conditions for collective success--and you can do that only when you consider your followers as well as yourself."

## Start Before You Begin

* Have as explicit an understanding as possible before your first day.
* Get answers to questions like:
    * How does your new boss define success?
    * Is she expecting minimal change, a complete overhaul, or something in between?
    * Does she have strong opinions regarding any of the people you are about to lead?
    * Did any of those people compete for the job you got?
    * How is overall morale?
* Those answers shape your initial agenda.
* Don't assume you know what your new boss has in mind for you--clarify.
* Find out the reputation of your group in the larger organization.
* Do not assume you understand the full context.
* What really drives the organization?
* Whose views and decisions really matter?
* Where are the alliances and rivalries?
* What is the meeting culture? Do meetings decide outcomes, or are they ratifications of previously made decisions?
* Some people will be for you, some against, most just want to wait and see, and don't feel strongly.
* Also look inward--think of someone you know who is a good leader, and one who is a bad one. Make a list of what makes the good leader worth following. Same for the bad one.
* Typically people gravitate to individuals they see as:
    * Fair
    * Inclusive
    * Transparent
    * Honest
    * Consistent
    * Clear about their intentions
    * Able to deliver results
* People are repelled by those who are:
    * Out for themselves
    * Secretive
    * Mercurial
    * Duplicitous
    * Apt to micromanage
* Write a short essay for yourself about why you want to lead. Helps get into the right mindset.
    * What impact do you want to have?
    * How will you know that it has mattered that you led the team?
    * What about leadership scares you?
* Make it the beginning of a leadership journal where you record what you learn about yourself and others as you lead.
* Reflect on the exercises, articulate the two or three concrete things you think are most important for people to know about you as a leader and how you will convey them. Write down how you intend to make those things apparent.
* Think about verbal and non-verbal communication. Be intentional about where you deliver your message and how you dress. What props? What seat do you take at the conference table? What do you want to project?

## First Impressions Matter...a Lot

* The people you intend to lead are measuring you, assessing for trust.
* Will you support them? Have their backs? Are they going to like working for you? Do they think you'll like having them around?
* We all have implicit biases. Most people have a deeply embedded idea of what a leader looks like: often tall, white men. If you don't benefit from that you may have to attend more immediately to the elements of trust that can help overcome those biases in people's minds.
* After an initial impression, confirmation bias kicks in. That's the tendency to remember and value things that confirm what you already believe.
* That's why it's important to identify the characteristics you want to project and consider how you're going to do so, even before you start the job.

## It's All about Connection

* Actions in the first ten days lay the foundation for perceptions of your leadership capacity and capability.
* "If you want to be a better leader, you should strive to be a better person." -- Warren Bennis
* Qualities of a "good person" might be things like
    * Says what they mean, means what they say
    * Treats others with respect
    * Someone who can be counted on
* Arriving as a new leader is like an arranged marriage--neither you nor your employees likely picked each other.
* The sooner people come to know you as a person, the more quickly they can make a rational and emotional judgment about you, which is what they base their decision to invest in following you on.
* Mindy Hall's book 'Leading with Intention: Every Moment is a Choice'
    * 'Transition Triangle' - represents the amount of energy and attention a leader puts into certain activities.
    * Incoming leaders tend to gravitate toward generating immediate operational results, and invest the least in forging connections. She says this is exactly backward.
* How to build trust? Charles Green proposes the "trust equation"
    * Equation:

        ```
        Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy
        ------------------------------------
                 Self-Orientation
        ```

    * Credibility - your perceived ability to do the job at hand
    * Reliability - reputation for doing what you say you will do
    * Intimacy - your ability to form trust-based relationships
    * Self-orientation - Your perceived commitment to yourself versus your commitment to the interests of the larger group.
    * Example for a new leader:
        * Credibility of 7/10, based on qualifications
        * Reliability of 2/10, haven't been able to demonstrate it yet
        * Intimacy of 6/10, if comfortable meeting people
        * Self-Orientation of 5/10, since it's unknown to your reports
        * Total of (7+2+6)/5 = 3, which is quite low (30/1 is best)
    * That example is based on initial perceptions of people who don't know you--making positive connections in the first ten days can boost the score by raising the numerator and lowering the denominator.
    * Building trust takes time--use the short term to prove your word is rock solid. Show up on time, take every obligation seriously.
    * Create conditions to demonstrate reliability
    * If reports ask for something, be specific about when you'll get it to them, and deliver it on time.
    * If they don't ask, give them a task that will inform you and give you the opportunity to deliver timely feedback, like a one-page overview of each person's top three current priorities.

## The Importance of Being Intentional

* Author runs a class exercise, where each person is to observe two classmates. No one knows who is watching whom.
* People quickly get creeped out.
* Some time in the second day they get the point--as a leader, you are *always* being watched.
* The scrutiny is never more intense than in the early days, when first impressions are forming. People look for any clues as to who you are as a person.
* The more puzzling you are, the more people fill in gaps with guesses. Being intentional minimizes those gaps.
* Mindy Hall says intentionality is being careful and disciplined about your choices moment by moment and being highly aware of your impact.
* Focus on a desired outcome and work backwards--what words, actions, and signals will get you there? Then simultaneously be in the moment and watch yourself in the moment to judge movement toward or away from the goal state.
* Exercise to build intentionality awareness:
    * For one day before you start the new job, engage everyone you encounter by name wherever possible, smile, make eye contact, and learn something new from them.
    * Typically you'll get a smile back, some positive body language response
    * Try to make notes of interesting effects in a leadership journal
* Deploy the technique with each new person you meet on the job.
* Make eye contact, smile, use their name. Nobody will punish you for forgetting technical information, but they will feel it if you forget their name.

## Taking Action

* In the first ten days you won't accomplish a major initiative, but you can put a stamp on your role and how you intend to carry it out.
* Look to make three meaningful decisions or take three substantive actions which:
    * Have a tangible impact
    * Reflect your leadership agenda
    * Have a solid rationale
* Make sure you have your boss's support, align your plans with her priorities.
* Make sure they are things you can follow through on, it undermines your credibility to backtrack.
* Examples:
    * If the unit is running well, you can opt to deliver something positive quickly, like an equipment upgrade they want. You could start the planning for a strategic off-site meeting to signal you'll be inclusive in planning.
    * If an objective is to increase efficiency, you could direct that all 60 minute meetings be cut to 45. Require an agenda that includes the meeting objective, key decisions to be made, and any expected advance reading or other preparation.
    * If you have a mandate for major change from your boss, you'll want to do something that will get everyone's immediate attention. Mentions firing people the first day, which worked for the guy who did it but isn't likely necessary.
    * Gentler approach: she was brought in for a turnaround, couldn't immediately clean house. Team was globally dispersed and large. She sent an email her first day, including a picture of her smiling to humanize her. Acknowledged that big changes were needed if the business was going to survive, and that she didn't think she had all the answers. Concluded with a request for ideas from everyone. They trickled in, she responded to every one. The volume increased, she kept responding. She got a reputation for being open and responsive. She ended up firing people who resisted the new direction, but also found people who had been repressed by the prior regime, who were full of ideas and energy, which she tapped into.
* Schedule 1:1 meetings with each direct report to learn about them and their work
* Need not happen in first ten days, but get them all scheduled, and stick to the schedule.
* Common question: how much personal info to share with subordinates?
    * Keep it measured, particularly at first.
    * Share positive information, avoid controversial or weighty topics
    * Exceptions for things that would be awkward if not addressed

## Avoiding Common Mistakes

* You'll make mistakes and recover from the small ones.
* Five common first 10 day mistakes to sidestep via planning and intentionality:
    * Failing to prepare and rehearse, *particularly* if you are new to leadership
    * Asserting too much authority too quickly. Ask tough questions, which conveys seriousness and intent to change, but isn't dictatorial.
    * Failing to respect the operational rhythm. Your arrival will disrupt that rhythm somewhat. You want your distraction to be minimal if the unit is running well.
    * Getting stuck in the weeds. You have to grasp the big picture while understanding the details. Micromanager is a bad thing.
    * Missing chances to adjust course. Spend 30 minutes each day to reflect in your journal, with ritual questions as a guide:
        * What did I learn about myself today?
        * What did I learn about others today?
        * What interaction went particularly well?
        * What interaction could have gone better? How?
        * What adjustments will I make tomorrow to improve my leadership outcomes?

# Influence Through Listening

Video, "Influencing People Honestly: Ethical Persuasion Strategies for Leaders, Managers, and Entrepreneurs", by Mark Levy

* Being listened to is very rare, particularly in business.
* Really listening to the other person is transformational, for both people.
* For the listener, you feel a connection to them, and forget your own problems while you're helping them.
* For the other, they feel valued, that their thinking counts. Your listening draws out a new level of thinking from them, because they feel that someone smart cares about what they're thinking.
* You want to help people with the process of doing their best thinking, because they'll love you for it.
* You become a go-to person when someone is struggling with an idea, which is a position of influence.
* How do go about being an influential listener?
* To begin: the next time someone comes to you with a problem, if it's an important problem, ask if they have time to talk about it for 15-20 minutes, because "I really want to pay attention to this."
* When they start to tell you about the situation, probably they won't know how to start. They're feeling too pressured to get out all the best information.
* Magic words / favorite questions for when people don't know what to say:
    * "What's obvious here?" - 'obvious' removes the demands of telling their story perfectly, and lets them start talking. The obvious things remind you of ways to get to new places.
    * "What's important here?" - don't start conversation with it, use it when they've been putting out a lot of information and you want them to reframe it
    * "What's surprising here?" - a surprise is that the situation changes to defeat your expectations. Where the surprise happened is often where you got stuck, or there's some new goal, new solution.
    * "What are the anomalies?" - tell me about what you didn't think would happen, but it happened
    * "What are the opportunities?" - another reframing device
    * "What are the risks here?" - lets people voice fears, which once enumerated can be solved or approached
    * "What's exciting about this?" - goes to a more personal, subjective place
    * "What scares you about the situation?" - nobody asks that, gets them to discuss things that don't usually come up at work
    * "What stories can you tell me about this?" - when things are too abstract or cognitive
* Noah Blumenthal helped with this, said he has a different three magic words
    * "Tell me more." - nobody gets asked that
* Important part of listening is to show people that you're listening.
* Show them that your mind is engaged with what they're saying
* Sort of active listening
* Every few minutes, he mentions something they already said, to show he's listening
* Also rephrase or reframe what they're saying, showing you're engaged with their ideas and stories
* When he gets a new client, he asks lots of factual, historical questions, taking lots of condensed notes, adds his own commentary to it. After about 20 minutes, he'll ask to read from his notes to make sure they're on the same page. They're always astonished, because they haven't had someone listen that closely to them.
* When they start a new session, they go to a more honest place, because he's demonstrated that he really deeply listens.
* When he doesn't understand, he tells people. If you just say, "I don't understand what you said," they'll repeat it verbatim, which doesn't work. His addition is, "I didn't understand what you said there, can you explain it a little differently?"
* Often he loses track of what people are saying, not because he's not listening, but because he's listening very closely. Sometimes he'll fixate on something they said, and he'll be missing it, and stop them, and tell them, "I haven't heard what you said for 30 seconds, because you said X, and I apologize, but can we go back to that?"
* If you know the person really well, you can just throw in ideas. Also if you have some expert status. If it's someone you don't know that well, or a peer, you may want to ask ahead of time if they want feedback, something like, "I have an idea for you. Is now a good time to share new ideas?" "Would you be open for a new way of seeing that?"
* You talking isn't beneficial to them, you have to gauge their readiness to receive what you're giving them.
* Say, "I really want to help you with that, do you have 20 minutes right now, because I'd really like to talk to you about that."
