## Chapter 1: The Nature of Wood

* All trees have common characteristics:
    * Vascular, perennial plants capable of secondary thickening (adding yearly growth to previous growth)
    * `stem` or `trunk` - visible, main supporting member
    * `bole` - a trunk large enough for conversion to timber or veneer
    * `crown` - branching subdivision(s) carrying leaves or foliage
    * `wood` - the bulk of the stem, inside the bark
    * `growth rings` - concentric growth additions
    * `pith` - core of the trunk
    * `cambium` - layer of living cells between bark and wood
* Tree stems are accumulations of cells
    * Cells are formed of a cell wall surrounding a cell cavity
    * Cavities may contain living protoplasm, nonliving sap, or air space
    * Typical structure is elongated, longitudinal cells, oriented vertically within the stem
    * `rays` - Additional groups of cells, arranged horizontally in the tree in flattened ribbons, with the ribbon's plane vertical
    * Rays provide horizontal conduction of sap, and may store carbohydrates
    * The largest longitudinal and ray cells are visible to the naked eye
* Similar cells group into functional units
    * `tissue` - grouping of similar cells
    * `bark tissue` or `wood tissue` come from their respective parts
    * `meristematic tissue` - reproductive cell groupings
    * `apical meristems` - growing tips of twigs, whose division creates elongation of the growth points of the tree
    * `lateral meristem` - the cambium, which divides to create thickness growth
* The tree has a complex internal system during the growing season
    * Water enters the roots and moves upwards through wood cells to the leaves
    * `transpiration` - evaporation of water from leaf surfaces, aiding cooling
    * `photosynthesis` - water in the leaves combines with atmospheric CO2, catalyzed by chlorophyll, and energized by sunlight
    * Photosynthesis gives off oxygen into the air, and creates a basic sugar C6-H12-O6 for the tree to use
    * `sap` - water in the tree, plus any dissolved nutrients and other materials
* Cambial cells have very thin primary walls, and are very watery during the growth season. Consequently the layer is very delicate / fragile, and can be peeled away from the freshly cut log.
* During winter the cambium thickens / stiffens and becomes less vulnerable to mechanical damage.
* Woodworking note: if you want the bark to stay attached, harvest during dormancy
* Cambium reproduction:
    * Cambium 'mother' cells reproduce by dividing lengthwise into 'daughter' cells
    * Of the two daughters, one becomes a new mother, the other becomes either a bark cell (if toward the outside) or a new wood cell (if toward the inside)
    * When developing daughter cells attain final size/shape, they get a secondary wall on the inner surface of the primary wall. Secondary wall becomes the dominant layer of the cell, makes the cell shape/size permanent.
    * `cellulose` - long chain molecules that are strong and stable, make up most of the secondary wall
    * `lignin` - additional fortification of the secondary wall, about 25% of total composition
* During the last stages of maturation:
    * Wood cells lose living protoplasm, have only sap
    * Some still conduct sap despite being non-living
    * `prosenchyma` - non-living, sap conducting cells
    * `sapwood` - layers that are still conducting sap but no longer living
    * Some cells (ray cells principally) in the sapwood retain protoplasm
    * `parenchyma` - living storage cells in the sapwood

### Growth Rings

* Cambium activity continues as long as environmental conditions are suitable and the tree is healthy
* Cyclic wood formation, as in temperate climates, creates visible growth layers
* `growth ring` or `annual ring` - visible, concentric layers of growth
* Rings may vary in width by species and growing conditions
* Most visual characteristics are the result of variation in cell diameter, cell wall thickness, and distribution of different cell types
* Visible contrast layers in growth rings:
    * `earlywood` - first layer formed in a growth season
    * `latewood` - remainder of growth after earlywood
    * Typically significant visual contrast corresponds to differences in density between early and latewood
    * Transition may be abrupt or gradual
    * Tropical growth may not have graduated growth due to lack of seasonal variation

### Grain

* `grain` - can have many, many different meanings in woodworking. Some are:
    * **planes and surfaces:** `end grain`, `face grain`, `long grain`, `longitudinal grain`, `radial grain`, `side grain`, `tangential grain`
    * **growth ring placement:** `bastard grain`, `edge grain`, `flat grain`, `mixed grain`, `plain grain`, `quarter grain`, `radial grain`, `rift grain`, `side grain`, `slash grain`, `tangential grain`, `vertical grain`
    * **growth ring width:** `close grain`, `coarse grain`, `dense grain`, `fine grain`, `narrow grain`, `open grain`
    * **earlywood/latewood contrast:** `even grain`, `uneven grain`
    * **alignment of longitudinal cells:** `Across the grain`, `Along the grain`, `against the grain`, `cross grain`, `curly grain`, `dip grain`, `grain direction`, `interlocked grain`, `short grain`, `slope of grain`, `spiral grain`, `steep grain`, `straight grain`, `wavy grain`, `with the grain`
    * **relative pore size:** `closed grain`, `coarse grain`, `fine grain`, `open grain`
    * **figure types:** `bird's-eye grain`, `blister grain`, `comb grain`, `crotch grain`, `curly grain`, `feather grain`, `fiddleback grain`, `flame grain`, `leaf grain`, `needle-point grain`, `quilted grain`, `rift grain`, `roey grain``, silver grain`, `stripe grain`, `tiger grain`
    * **machining defects:** `chipped grain`, `fuzzy grain`, `loosened grain`, `raised grain`, `shelled grain`, `torn grain`, `woolly grain`
    * **figure imitation:** `graining`, `woodgrain design`
    * **surface failure:** `short in the grain`
* Term often refers to the direction of the dominant longitudinal cells of a stem
* `uneven grain` - in relation to early- vs. latewood, high contrast
* `even grain` - low contrast between early and late

### Sapwood and Heartwood

* In small stems (twigs, saplings), all wood is involved in sap conduction
* Larger stems have non-living portions that may conduct sap (sapwood) and store it for food
* In the layers nearest the pith, the prosenchyma cells stop conducting sap, and the parenchyma cells die, which transforms that portion to `heartwood`
* The transition to heartwood also forms material in the cell wall called `extractives`
* Most significant to the woodworker are the color variations in the heartwood
* Sapwood in all species ranges from whitish to yellow or light tan
* Darker colors are from heartwood extractives
* Sapwood is not generally resistant to fungi, so decay resistance is due to the toxicity of extractives in heartwood
* Additional extractive properties can include permeability changes, increased density / stability, abrasiveness
* Heartwood diameter increases with overall diameter
* Proportion of sapwood to heartwood is species dependent

### Structural Arrangement of Growth Rings and Rays

* Wood structure has to be considered three dimensionally
* `transverse plane` or `cross-sectional plane` is perpendicular to the stem axis (end grain of a stump)
* `radial plane` is a vertical plane passing through the pith, as the radius of a circle
* `tangential plane` is parallel to the pith, but not passing through it, forming a tangent to the growth rings
* `X`, `R`, and `T` are used to denote slices in the respective planes
* Pieces whose broad face is more or less in the radial grain are termed `radial grain`, `edge grain`, or `vertical grain`
* Those pieces are `quartersawn` and their surfaces are `quartergrain`
* Quartersawn applies to pieces where the growth rings for angles of 45 to 90 degrees with the surface
* Approximately tangentially cut pieces are `flatsawn`, `flat-grained`, or `tangential grained`
* `mixed grain` quantities have both edge-grain and flatsawn pieces
* `bastard grain` refers to growth rings oriented between 30 degrees and 60 degrees to the surface

### Density and Specific Gravity

* Density is the single most important indicator of strength in wood
* Dense woods generally shrink and swell more and present greater drying problems
* `specific gravity` is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a standard substance (typically water)
* Typically to get it you compare oven-dry weight and current volume
* 'hardwood' and 'softwood' are essentially meaningless terms in relation to density

### Systematic Classification

* `spermatophytes` are seed plants, which are divided into
    * `gymnosperms` (naked seeds) produce softwood lumber
    * `angiosperms` (covered seeds) yield hardwood lumber
* Commercial softwood timber in north america is from the order _Coniferales_
* Conifers have needlelike or scalelike foliage (typically evergreen)
* `excurrent` tree form - straight and dominant main stem with subordinate lateral branching (conifers)
* Conifers range from about 0.30 to 0.55 average specific gravity
* Angiosperms include ~22 families in the United States
* Hardwoods are mostly `deciduous`, meaning leaves fall in the autumn
* These are `dendritic` or `deliquescent`, meaning branching and rebranching of the main stem

### Cellular Structure

### Softwoods

* Relatively simple structure compared with hardwoods
* Most cells in coniferous wood are `tracheids`, 90-95% of volume
* Tracheids are fiberlike cells about 100 times longer than their diameter
* Average length is between 2 and 6mm
* A cubic inch contains an average of 4 million tracheids
* Diameters range from 20 to 60 micrometers
* Texture of the wood is a function of the tracheid diameter--redwood has the largest, is 'coarse'
* You can estimate coarseness based on how many individual tracheids are visible with a 10x hand lens
* Conduction and support of the tree are done by the nonliving (prosenchymatous) tracheids
* In earlywood they're larger in diameter and thin walled, for conduction; latewood are thicker walled and smaller diameter, good for support of the tree
* Difference in early and latewood tracheids determines the evenness of the grain
* Uneven conifer grain has a consequence in staining, where earlywood is lighter but more porous, so it stains darker
* Using flatsawn softwood as stair treads or flooring can cause uneven wear of early and late wood, leaving raised latewood as the softer early wood wears away
* Some species have resin canals, tubes lined with living epithelial cells that exude resin
* Resin canals are in pine, spruce, larch, and doug fir
* In sapwood the resin in canals is quite fluid, and can take years to solidify in the wood
* Kiln drying above 175F is needed to set the resin and minimize bleed-out
* Resin spots tend to bleed through paint films
* Rays in softwood are narrow, typically one cell wide, typically invisible

### Hardwoods

* Most lack resin canals, though some tropical species have gum ducts
* Rays vary widely in size, some visible
* Many more cell types, much more variation in their arrangement
* Believed to have evolved later than softwoods
* Cells are more specialized by function; conduction and support are done by specialized cells
* `vessel elements` - specialized cells, relatively large in diameter with thin walls. Formed in end to end arrangements, which create continuous vessels, ideal for sap conduction
* `fibers` - small diameter, closed ends, thick walls, create strength and support
* `pore` - the cut end of a vessel
* All hardwoods have vessels, so they are also known as 'porous woods' (softwoods being 'nonporous')
* `ring-porous woods` - oak, ash, elm, chestnut, catalpa; largest pores are in the earlywood; usually pronounced uneven grain, distinct figures and patterns
* `diffuse-porous woods` - maple, birch, basswood, yellow-poplar; pores evenly distributed; typically small diameter pores
* `semi-ring-porous woods` - pores are large in the earlywood, get smaller in the latewood but with no distinct zoning
* Pore size is a measure of texture; red oak is coarse, sweetgum is fine
* `tyloses` - bubblelike structures in the cavities of vessel elements, in the transition from sapwood to heartwood
* Other longitudinal cells are uniform diameter, smaller than visible to the naked eye
* Fiber masses are darker, tracheids and parenchyma cells are lighter
* Ray structure in some woods represents planes of structural weakness
* `ray fleck` - Ray appearance on the radial surface of the wood, characteristic of certain woods

## Chapter 2: Figure in Wood

* `figure` - distinctive or characteristic markings on longitudinal or side-grain surfaces
* Results from a combination of normal / abnormal growth and the orientation of the surface revealed by cutting
