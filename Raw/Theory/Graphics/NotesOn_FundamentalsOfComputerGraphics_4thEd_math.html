    <h3>Sets and Mappings</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>A 'mapping' is analogous to a function. Considered in terms of sets, you can say that a function may act on one set (inputs) to produce a second set (outputs). The inputs are the 'domain' of the function, the outputs are the 'range' or 'target'.</li>
      <li>There may be inverse functions or mappings. For some function <i>f</i>(a) &rarr; b, the inverse function <i>f</i><sup>-1</sup> is that which fulfills <i>g</i>(b) &rarr; a.</li>      <li>A function and its inverse together are a 'bijection'. Bijections map every a in A to a unique b in B, and for every b in B there is exactly one a in A such that <i>f</i>(a) = b.</li>
      <li>Functions that are not bijections have no inverse.</li>
      <li>An interval is a set of numbers between endpoints. If the endpoints are included in the set it is a 'closed interval', if they are excluded it is an 'open interval.' A single interval may have a closed and an open endpoint, or both closed/open.</li>
      <li>Intervals are useful in conjunction with the set operations intersection, union, and difference.</li>
      <li>Logarithms are often useful in equations with exponential terms.</li>
      <li>Every logarithm has a base <i>a</i>, which equates for a term <i>x</i> to 'the exponent to which <i>a</i> must be raised to get <i>x</i>.'</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Solving quadratic equations</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>A quadratic equation has the form <i>Ax</i><sup>2</sup> + <i>Bx</i> + <i>C</i> = 0, where <i>x</i> is a real unknown, and <i>A, B, C</i> are constants.</li>
      <li>Quadratic equations produce parabolas when plotted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Trigonometry</h3>

    <h3>Vectors</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Only the lowest level vector operations should be aware of their numeric representation--otherwise always treat vectors as objects.</li>
      <li>A 2D vector can be written as a combination of any two nonzero vectors which are not parallel. This property of the two vectors is 'linear independence.' Two linearly independent vectors form a 2D 'basis', which makes them 'basis vectors.'</li>
      <li>Cartesian coordinates are vectors via a system of orthonormal basis vectors.</li>
      <li>Any set of vectors form an orthonormal basis provided they are orthogonal and are each of unit length.</li>
    </ul>
