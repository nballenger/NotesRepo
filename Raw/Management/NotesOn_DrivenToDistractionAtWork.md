# Notes on Driven To Distraction At Work

By Ned Hallowell, Harvard Business Review Press, 2015; ISBN 978-1-4221-8641-1

## Introduction: Attention Deficit Trait, the Growing Workplace Problem

* Book's assumptions:
    * "Any person can learn to modulate distraction and overload well enough to take greater control, while becoming happier, healthier, and more productive in the process."
    * Common advice around time management, to-do lists, etc. don't work / can't work.
    * You have to retrain your attention [...] Event if you can't control your environment, you can learn how to reach a more productive mental state of focus, relying on priming, preparation, and technique instead of the frantic efforts people typically use to control their time and attention.
* Part 1 covers six most common ways of surrendering attention at work
* Part 2 gives an overall plan for managing and training your attention over time

### Attention Deficit Trait

* Author is an MD who has studied attention and productivity for a long time
* ADT is a trait he coined in 1994 to describe the attention splintering aspects of modern work and life
* Wrote a HBR article called "Overloaded Circuits: Why Smart People Underperform" and a book called "CrazyBusy"
* ADT is external and contextual, in contrast to ADD or ADHD
* ADT gradually is more and more of a problem
* By 10am many individuals have developed some of these symptoms:
    * Heightened distractability
    * Persistent feeling of being rushed or in a hurry even without need to be
    * Mounting feeling of life being superficial
    * Inability to sustain lengthy and full attention to a thought, conversation, etc.
    * Growing tendency toward impatience, boredom, dissatisfaction, restlessness, irritability, frustration, or frenzy sometimes approaching panic
    * Tendency to make impulsive decisions
    * Hopping from task to task, idea to idea
    * Avoiding thinking or reflection altogether
    * Tendency to put off difficult work or conversations
    * Filling the day with busywork
    * Feeling overwhelmed even when objectively you are not
    * Haunting feelings of guilt about incomplete tasks, coupled with resentment at the tasks being imposed in the first place.
    * Difficulty fully enjoying pleasant moments and genuine achievements
    * "I'm working really hard but I'm not getting to where I want to be"
    * Feeling of loss of control, nagging feeling of "What am I missing?"
    * Recurring thought: "Someday I'll make time for things that matter, but I can't now"
    * Growing, compulsive need for frequent hits of micro-information
    * Tendency to overcommit, allow too any interruptions, say yes too quickly

### The price of ADT

* Fucks up productivity all over the place.
* Makes life all miserable and shit.

### Prescription for Focus

* 2013 book by Daniel Goleman, "Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence" gives "an excellent account of why focus is important to achieving goals," but "doesn't look at the many ways people lose their ability to focus at work or provide practical solutions"
* Most people don't see focus as the problem, instead blaming themselves
* They're worried about their jobs, relationships, families, but only blame themselves -- they don't make excuses or blame others.
* "People are usually in more pain than they let on. If they even recognize how much their problem relates to impaired focus, they deal with it simply by trying to overpower it. [...] Ironically, the harder they try, the more likely they are to fail, which leads them to blame themselves even more, thus intensifying the problem."

### The six most common distractions at work--and how to overcome them

* Thumbnail sketches of the six distractions from Part 1:
    * **Screen Sucking** - electronic devices create and exacerbate continuous partial attention via 'screen addiction' and similar
    * **Multitasking** - Overcommitting is symptomatic of an inability to say no
    * **Idea Hopping** - lots of people have ideas, the problem is getting them finished
    * **Worrying** - People procrastinate as a way to salve anxiety
    * **Playing the Hero** - Don't carry the negative water for your organization
    * **Dropping the Ball** - True ADD can be self-diagnosed as failure or inability and make you underachieve and chronically try to self-right without the proper tools
* Each chapter tries to zero in on the emotions of the case study, not just catalog the details of the situation.

### Training your attention -- how to manage and maintain your ability to focus

* Part 2 focuses on specific techniques for developing habits for focus:
    * **Energy** - take steps to monitor your brain's energy supply
    * **Emotion** - Emotion is the on-off switch for learning and for peak performance. Emotional state drives quality of focus; fear fucks up your focus, trust repairs it. Taking care of your emotional state requires introspection and effort. "Positive emotion [...] galvanizes engagement."
    * **Engagement** - Interest + motivation = engagement. Ideally you'd work at the intersection of what you love, what you are good at, and what advances the mission of the group (or what you can get paid to do). Should be some novelty to it, and some creative input to hold your attention.
    * **Structure** - How you use boundaries, rules, and help to shape your day.
    * **Control** - "If you don't take your time, it will be taken from you."
* Author created some assessments available at http://hbr.org/assessments/adt

# Part 1: Six most common distractions

## Chapter 1: Screen Sucking - how to control your electronics so they don't control you

* Story of a guy with tons of open windows to different ideas and distractions.
* While doing rote, familiar tasks, he works without pause
* Boss wants him to think more, do less constant-motion "work"
* People who fit ADT in this chapter tend to agree with:
    * If my phone is out of reach, I feel distressed
    * I can waste an hour online without knowing it
    * I have more to do than time to do it
    * I lack discipline
    * I secretly go online at work and at home
    * I often retreat into the cyber world when stressed at work
    * I can't imagine not taking my smartphone to lunch with me
    * I always want more
    * I underachieve at work
    * I have the will, I just haven't found the way
* The guy in the chapter is a research analyst at an investment firm
* Over the past years and months he's noticed the quality of his work going down--"he couldn't help but notice the emptiness within himself now and again"
* Rather like data overload was killing his curiosity and wit, making days drab
* Lots of movement while doing rote report building, camouflage action
* "He was stalled in fast-revving mental neutral. He took on nothing difficult. He suffered no pain. He saw no gain."

### Lights on, but nobody home

* Guy knew his job was in danger, though he couldn't tell what was wrong with him
* His wife says: "The sad part is that you've been preoccupied [with screens and work] for years and you haven't even known it."
* He did know it though, in the odd moments he let himself think about it. Those moments just goaded him into more distraction though.
* Lack of access to screens and info-hits would bring on withdrawal feelings

### Les's addiction

* The form of ADT that is a compulsion to always be online is very fast-growing.
* Most of these addicts are extremely gifted, and also gradually self-destructing
* "Denial is the most common trick addicts play on themselves to justify continuing their addiction."
* There are many forms of digital addiction or self-destructive habits. Some are:
    * Student attached to video games to the exclusion of studying
    * Sneaking smart phone time during meetings
    * preoccupation with pornography or similar distraction
    * Online affairs
* No real precedent for this kind of addiction, but we can take some general direction from dealing with other addictions and bad habits
* There's a big list of pros and cons to electronic devices. Yay.

### What exactly is screen addiction?

* Time online can activate the same dopamine circuits seen in other addictions
* We don't know how to talk about screens very well
* Linda Stone came up with "continuous partial attention"--scanning for opportunities for excitement, essentially seeking tiny dopamine hits
* A number of other terms have cropped up since:
    * PCU - problematic computer use
    * CA - computer addiction
    * CAD - communication addiction disorder
    * IA - internet addiction
    * "Internet use disorder" from DSM-5 is listed in "Conditions for Further Study"
* DSM 5 on internet gaming disorder; 5 or more of these in a 12 month period:
    * Preoccupation with Internet games
    * Withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away
    * Need to spend increased time in gaming due to tolerance
    * Unsuccessful attempts to control participation in gaming
    * Loss of interest in previous hobbies and entertainment
    * Continued use of gaming despite knowledge of harm
    * Deception of family members, therapists, or others re: gaming
    * Use of games to escape or relieve a negative mood
    * Has jeopardized or lost significating relationship, job, or opportunity
* Author suggests "problematic use of electronic devices" as the term to use
* Classifies PUED into five levels:
    0. No symptoms
    1. Conflictive - usage is annoying to at least one other person
    2. Mild - annoying to others if not the user, does not abate when urged
    3. Moderate - above plus causing problems in personal or professional life, plus user may deny or acknowledge problem
    4. Severe - Above, plus demonstrably destructive, user feels inability to control
    5. Addictive - above, plus at least two of:
        1. Salience - activity is most important in users life
        2. Mood-modification - soothing, high, or numbing feeling from use
        3. Tolerance - increasing amounts of use for same effect
        4. Withdrawal - some or all of: craving, irritability, anger, agitation, bargaining, rule or law breaking to gain access, insomnia, waking in night, dreaming of using, inability to focus, somatic symptoms like headache, aches and pains, lethargy, stupor
        5. Conflict - with others and within self due to usage
        6. Relapse - tendency to resume previous maladaptive patterns
* "The trick for me was to replace the moral diagnosis that Les, at some deep level, had attached to himself--namely, 'you are bad, weak, undisciplined, and a loser'--and replace it with a morally neutral diagnosis that confers some hope like, 'You have important gifts you have yet to unwrap.'"
* Prescribed human connection as a replacement for screen time
* Followed model by Lance Dodes, MD, who believes "addiction serves to reverse an overwhelming sense of helplessness. The minute the addict _decides_ to use [...] the addict feels better. He feels pleasure and relief, just from having made the decision to use. It is not the substance or the activity that brings the pleasure at first, but _the decision to use it_."
* Goes on to say that "while relieving helplessness is the function of addiction, the driving force behind it is rage at that helplessness [...] but rather than feel the rage and express it directly, which could reverse the addiction, the addict [...] uses his drug or activity, rather than feeling his true emotions.
* Dangers associated with each element of treatment:
    1. Energy - addiction to electronics drains mental energy
    2. Emotion - screen time is trance-like and emotionally neutral or dead
    3. Engagement - feeling no emotion, your only engagement is the ongoing synaptic stimulation you get, so you disengage with people, tasks, ideas that you might otherwise engage with
    4. Structure - the structure of the device takes your attention, corrupts your structure
    5. Control - in addiction you fail to exercise the control you have, and at some level you lose that control
    
### 10 tips for reducing screen sucking

1. Honestly assess how much time you spend on electronics each day. Most people grossly underestimate this.
2. Based on that, gauge where you should cut back. This is likely your largest or nearly largests waste of time.
3. Create pockets in your day reserved for screen time. Outside those, turn it off.
4. Turn off your devices during social engagements.
5. When bored, don't use devices--do something more productive.
6. Keep a list of things to do when bored.
7. Avoid addictive or habit forming websites and games.
8. Encourage your working group to create norms around response times.
9. Make judicious use of face to face communication.
10. Measure and monitor your progress. Monitor the time you save and the increase in the volume and quality of your work.

## Chapter 2: Multitasking - how to say no when you have more to do than time to do it

* People who fit the ADT in this chapter tend to agree with:
    * I can't get my work done without multitasking
    * Saying no is very hard for me to do
    * I'd be in charge if I could just use my time more effectively
    * If I could get organized I'd be more successful
    * If I could clone myself I'd be fine
    * At work I have more trouble than others preventing interruptions
    * I wish people at work would leave me alone so I could get things done
    * I wish I had an uninterrupted hour
* Case study is overworked woman who is an attorney and mother
* Too many responsibilities, stress, leads to what author terms 'DANGER zone':
    * D - disappointment/defeat leads to
    * A - anger and blame leads to
    * N - negativity leads to
    * G - globalizing negative feelings leads to
    * E - escape into wasteful/dangerous activities leads to
    * R - rejection of help, others, life
* Suggested to patient that she CDE: Curtail, Delegate, Eliminate
* Patient had not done previously out of fear that saying no risked losing everything
* Dangers associated with each element of treatment:
    1. Energy - run ragged by pleasing everyone / doing everything
    2. Emotion - anger builds up over time
    3. Engagement - overengagement leads to lack of focus, bad structure
    4. Structure - emotional makeup prevented her from forming helpful structure
    5. Control - gave control to a sense of duty / pleasing others
    
### 10 tips for multitaskers and people who can't say no

1. "Multitasking" is actually task switching. Fine for simple or rote tasks, but destructive for complex work.
2. Partial attention in many areas means you'll miss something in some of them
3. There's normal multitasking--autonomous functioning--that's fine.
4. It's only dangerous when one or more tasks require present attention/focus
5. An inability to say no can lead to overload. Practice saying no.
6. "I'd love to do that if I had time."
7. Remember that you'll burn out if you don't say no.
8. Learn to delegate
9. Engagement happens most easily when you're doing what you like and are good at--say yes to that stuff.
10. Understand that you benefit both parties by honestly saying no.

## Chapter 3: Idea hopping - how to finish what you start

* Case study is about someone who can't follow through despite having resources.
* People who fit this chapter's version of ADT agree with:
    * I have so many ideas, I don't know what to do with them all
    * I love the start of projects and the conclusion, it's the middle I have trouble with
    * I stay awake at night with new ideas running through my mind
    * I avoid doing difficult work by doing busywork
    * My actions can't keep up with my imagination
    * I get bored when the novelty of a new project wears off
    * My biggest problem is learning how to prioritize
    * My problem is that nothing grabs me enough for me to stick with it when it gets boring.

### The despair of infinite possibility

* Kierkegaard: "more and more becomes possible because _nothing becomes actual_"
* Concept of "conation"--an innate style of getting things done. From Kathy Kolbe.
* Hugely variable across individuals
* "few people have the cognitive, conative, or affective range to do everything involved in taking a project from initial idea to completed product solo"
* The inborn style of the chapter subject "does not include the ability to get things done on her own"

### Ashley's backstory

* The despair of infinite possibility is common now because communication technology makes so many possibilities immediately available.
