# Introduction: Mapping Vulnerability

By Dorothea Hilhorst and Greg Bankoff

* What makes people vulnerable?
    * One level: Poverty, resource depletion, marginalization
    * Another: Diversity of risks generated by interplay of local and global processes
* Nature of vulnerability is changing / intensifying, people's ability to cope diminishing
* "Living with the poverty and uncertainty of their daily existence severely constrains their freedom of choice and leaves them prey to a creeping despair that the magnitude and frequency of natural and human-induced disasters only make worse."
* All the authors in this book "contribute a different perspective to the problem [of vulnerability], all seeking in some way to resolve the apparent contradiction of reconciling local experiences with global considerations."

## Vulnerability, Disaster and Development

* Concept of vulnerability is key to a new understanding of 'risk'
* Old concept of 'disaster' framed as purely physical occurrences, requiring largely technological solutions
* Per Lewis 1999, better to view those events as the result of human actions--as the 'actualization of social vulnerability'
* Terry Cannon - hazards are natural, disasters are not
* Social relations / power relations generate unequal exposure to risk--some people more prone to disaster
* If you want to understand disaster, you should understand 'the ways in which human systems place people at risk in relation to each other and their environment--a relationship that can best be understood in terms of an individual's, a household's, a community's or a society's _vulnerability_.'
